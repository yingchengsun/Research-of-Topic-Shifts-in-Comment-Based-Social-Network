n<11> people want help! 1980's just begun nursing career AIDS/HIV epidemic entering states. worked oncology unit patients affected HIV sent. years old yet. remember hospital staff refusing gown take care patient, volunteered too! years old even family come see worried affected! go visit shift just sit room visiting life scared since even hospital staff spend anymore time room needed. finally asked one day fearful getting HIV him. said made choice take care people matter outcome may be. reason spent much time realized... one family members friends? want people entrusted care turn back fear? answer NO! will turn back someone else's time need can help them. less months watched young man wither looked 70's died. heart knew alone, made sure that. Although many worried if's .... need live today. also mind owning go see anytime able leave room was. please think illness also isolation EBOLA patients going now. family member honestly walk away! 
s<12> ""PRESIDENT EBOLA: Obama Administration Scrapped CDC Quarantine Regulations Aimed Ebola"" 
s<13> U.N.? military sent Africa. Let U.N. send people. Military already cut bare bones now suppose risk lives this? rest world needs kick help. STOP FLIGHTS part Africa let anyone passport countries come here. "leaders" just completely lost minds? 
n<14> protocol lapses. Mr. Duncan said visited west Africa. told direct contact seriously ill woman Ebola. also told Liberian officials exposure, well. triggered better health care, exposed. Instead, family wants blame hospital hospitals health care workers fault. Nurses hospital staff help #$%$, kiss it! 
n<15> far funding goes, media keeps talking underfunded... go Africa news website, click different countries affected, etc. saying UN , amongst countries, including US , funded billions dollars--- just billion pledge, UN. 
s<16> need deal Ebola/Marburg. new thing, maybe is. 
s<17> many folks nurse treat figured low grade fever? think hospital gave paid time treating patient? Seriously? ...we knuckleheads CDC sitting white house..this get bad gets better...if spreads know showing clinic/hospital unless e/r deathbed. can imagine going grocery store, church, bank etc people hack lung everywhere.... 
s<18> think disease just getting started done will claim many lives already has....The CDC let happen...it prevented...Africa full disease long allowed exsist current state will continue happen...If mistaken Africa also birth place AIDS...Look many people infected global scale 
n<19> "We know occurred care index patient, original patient, Dallas, point breach protocol, breach protocol resulted infection," CDC director Dr. Thomas Frieden told news conference. R U F'in kidding me? Will someone PLEASE FIRE MORON!!! know occurred something occurred...OBVIOUSLY!!! healthcare worker Ebola infected nations, one Spain now US gotten it. think idea spreading. Stop people region coming here. CLOSE BORDERS! Quarantine EVERYONE came contact TOTALLY A-symptomatic. really bad situation right now people charge IDEA. Time fire get people will right. 
n<20> Ebola survivor Nancy Writebol also know got virus: 
s<21> Ebola/Marburg Zombie boards bus, sits back, middle back seat. 
n<22> stopped working two days ago ? need stop treating like bad cold get serious. many people contact clinical setting. continue repeat thing contract virus. recent article LA times original scientist discovered Ebola said virus new really say know ways spread, rule fact may air born. 
n<23> ebola hard spread trained health care workers catching it.

n<25> research Drs. Ron Fouchier Yoshihiro Kawaoka looked making bird flu evolve super flu spread air animals back 2011. Previously, mainly got H5n1 H7N9 close contact infected birds. person person. able achieve air borne status H5N1 virus genetically modifying it. used Ferrets host evolution, mother nature likely taken maybe hundreds years wanted prove can lab, mother nature can too, course see logic rational, right? 
n<26> Sure sounds like Ebola can airborne respirators used place simple face shields. Since protocols followed medical worker Spanish nurse contracted avoid idea air transmission? Liberia's head doctor got early meticulously following protocols. protocols hole one big hole respirator times. Obama stop inflights West Africans per day. potential ticking time bomb imported. placebo screening methods put place thermometer mouth extremely weak given day period become symptomatic. Japanese developed minute Ebola test $500 tell traveler safe board not. Without strong screening measures flying first place. Especially given fact viable treatment cure widely available yet. exposure population unacceptable POTUS. 
s<27> 鈥淒on鈥檛 touch walls!鈥? Western medical technician yelled out. 鈥淭otally infected.鈥? 
n<28> need travel ban immediately US West Africa, need detain return illegal border crossings. case happened Duncan denied visa. arguments civilian travel ban erroneous. Travelers can tracked visas restricted. Aid can continue flow West Africa aid workers seeking return can placed quarantine safe period, monitored return. Pretty soon, cases Ebola US result administration's irresponsible containment strategy will able track monitor contacts potentially infected. expense will skyrocket. ability help West Africa will diminish will consumed disease US. CDC position recommending travel ban outrageous. now put many innocent Americans risk, now healthcare workers life balance. "know all" CDC administration first repeatedly assured first Ebola will reach shores, assured can contained. proved wrong statement "fully confident" precautions sufficient. 
s<29> Nurses screaming years maybe good time remind hospitals medical errors!!!!!! Hundreds people KILLED every day U.S. due medical errors nurses afraid report breach protocol due retaliation. Just policy states retaliation allowed mean happen. going guess someone follow protocol possibly someone saw afraid report it. 
s<30> Government: 
s<31> White House Press Corpse briefing President Obama said, "If like Ebola can keep Ebola." Fox New's Ed Henry hammered President questions others corpse later said "not appropriate" free press. pressing President refused block entry people passports Liberia West Aftican countries Mr. Obama seemed lose patience Mr. Henry others room apparently understand brilliance. "Look, Fox News likes get viewers riled stuff. uh. well know smidgen Ebola Washington likely reported elections. simple fact quarantines work." 
n<32> sorry, nothing CDC president says gives confidence can handle Ebola. many failures federal institutions, particularly recently VA, just think Americans can rely say. public health emergency Obama authority responsibility stop Ebola victim entering US. Ebola Africa decades. new. new introduction US. 
s<33> do-gooder missionaries funded Duncan's air travel states prosecuted bio-terrorism. makes infected person, like Duncan, less dangerous Americans Islamo-terrorists? Duncan taken stroll crowded Dallas shopping mall utter chaos pandemonium Texas today. 
s<34> time annual trip Mecca. Saudi Arabia sense declare PEOPLE PLAGUE INFESTED COUNTRIES ALLOWED, PERIOD! leaders Saudi Arabia smarter (Democrat politicians) currently leading USA? Yes, America's stature fallen, especially last years! Now, currently charge damage....? less weeks can change insisting USA secured using measures table, includes halting VISAS securing borders halting flights plague zones. Anyone seeking enter USA (legally) must quarantined days ends, here. ever reason halt illegal entry, terrorism Obola come mind, now time! 
n<35> Protocols supposed robust enough compensate human failures. far protocols worked Texas. far media accepted vague hazy pronouncements officials. Just now Face Nation CDC commit nothing learned going improve protocols. evaded even question many now observed stating hours old exact number. interested know greater less dozen range type (lack of) information fuels peoples imaginations increases (hopefully) needless fear. 
n<36> Liberia, well trained people level containment suits routinely get Ebola die. hospitals give nurses gloves surgical masks. "breakdown protocols." PROTOCOL. [What think housekeepers wearing first visit?]This administration can bring ebola America, refusing stop flights west Africa [that RACIST, excuse, sure. every thing try bring country] Now assure us new case pass others, obviously way actually knowing that, know month minimum. disease, loosed one project house downtown Dallas, easily kill people lost 9-11, cost exponentially Obama's stole Michelle's friend Solyndra swindel combined, yet every day jet lands JFK, direct Africa. administration just sent thousands troops area. think plans quarantine get back. bet NO, unless raise kinds noise force happen. Call congressman demand close borders, stop flights, quarantine everyone there. risks enormous 
s<37> diversity preached last years coming home roost.&nbsp; 
n<38> Health care workers ones handle bed sheets clothing worn infected person. menial, messy chores doctors do. person aware infectious agent Ebola, surprise first victim Ebola patient health care worker. appears early on, one aware Mr. Duncan's true condition. Now somebody paying high price come. 
n<39> Obama MUST accept fact so-called "enhanced screening" put effect stopped late Mr Duncan, since showing symptoms arrived US. addition, Mr Duncan honest Liberia told screener truth recent contact with; sick Liberian lady, never arrived shores. travel ban Ebola hotspots saves even one American life, worth it! request honest US government effort try screen IMPLEMENT TRAVEL BAN anyone travelled either directly, connecting flights, Ebola pandemic nations. 
n<40> breach procedure US allowing ebola patients come in. joker director CDC go wants blame health workers things even know. government wanted disease outbreak US. know reasons, now trying blame everybody else themselves. nurses let doctors so-called specialists take care patients see goes. just sick government killing people.Time buy FEMA coffin. 
s<41> LOL keep telling y'all plagues mentioned Revelation poured sinful world. Blaming president, ebola, police, islamists, christians, easter bunny, old nasty neighbor anyone answer going save you. Scripture clearly states NONE shall escape judgement time! Stop hating, humble yourselves, leave bigotries sinful ways. Maybe Lord will mercy you!!! 
s<42> Angry? livid! Protect borders! Stop VISAS &amp; flights infected plague zones IMMEDIATELY! remove every illegal alien shores come last years (for good measure), especially illegal minors now bringing polio-like illness (since school started) ever go (President 'Obola' distributed EVERY SINGLE STATE, them)! Vote current crop November cast vote conservative, since likely 'do right thing', protect USA enemies "FOREIGN DOMESTIC" (which NOW includes President 'Obola')! 
s<43> Mr. Duncan red eyes, dead giveaway Ebola/Marburg since just 
s<44> control? Sept 16..Obama.."First foremost, want American people know experts, CDC across government, agree chances Ebola outbreak United States extremely low. We鈥檝e taking necessary precautions, including working countries West Africa increase screening airports someone virus doesn鈥檛 get plane United States"... Now, feel safer? 
s<45> interview screenings. 
s<47> nothing fear except government itself. 
s<48> Interesting nations next door Ebola zones successfully stopped virus borders yet US Ocean away seeing Ebola problems already. Something right picture. 
n<49> Healthcare workers providing bedside care come contact body fluids waste products. conditions protocol can guarantee 100% safety exposed. 
s<50> anyone considering moving away big city slower, relaxed way life country NOW TIME. 
s<51> given erosion quickly civil rights guaranteed US Constitution [RIP habeas corpus] indeed surprising CDC backing Homeland Security make sure disease come country. civil rights eroded destroyed god forbid traveler stopped border allowed entry because, course, commerce important public safety. 
n<52> Well wonder Mr. Duncan's family say now someone volunteered care man lied exposed entered US even decency say exposed Ebola. Sure told Liberia, failed say cared someone Ebola. family disgusts me, trying pull race card. held responsible cost care, financial loss hospital (no longer excepting emergency room patients) cost decontamination past, current future costs associated fighting Ebola US. Maybe shut up. it, send mouth piece Jesse Jackson Liberia strap bed Ebola patient recently died in. sick Al Sharpton creating hate discontent, can push political agendas. Close boarders anyone coming infected country unless spent days isolation. democrats liberals start whining comments, registered democrat. days siding right feel fool way voted last election. 
s<53> Obama worst president history. college degree history, im evangelical, regular american leans conservative. Obama disaster middle class promote greatness country has. Obama much communist lives past. Obama believes making SINS colonialism. Obama worst jimmy carter Woodrow wilson 
s<54> sending military help Africa? 
n<55> anyone ask contact first time came hospital many people come contact two days hospital turn away first time. time allow anyone country traveled Africa flights connected travelers Africa. done long time ago. leader commander chief? CDC? blame this. Another failure lack action. going spread like wild fire us going say told so. Wake up. Time work harder vaccine. Mr. President, leadership? 
s<56> FALSE FLAG TERRORISM . new ISIS? EBOLA crisis suddenly come in? FALSE FLAG= government gets back corner, create CRISIS change tide.. Cover truth REALLY doing.. 
n<57> Dr. Friedan people supposedly run country kept ORIGINAL Ebola protocols place, poor woman facing battle now. Close borders, demand accountability CDC government! 
s<58> Travel Ban anywhere Africa completely close southern border. Whomever currently will undergo days isolation rigorous monitoring make certain clear allow US, Cancel shipments Africa, way stop it. 
n<59> apparent CDC protocols sufficient. suspect entire medical community, including CDC, knows just much Ebola Black Death Middle Ages. 
s<60> hubris humankind "Oh know control outbreaks, OK". 
s<61> special US public used lab rats great experiment testing Frieden's political correctness Obama's liberal, progressive immigration policies? 
s<62> Obama stopped flights Ebola countries? 
s<63> Another Obama failure. Ebola never brought U.S. made decision, folks administration came protocols blame work. 
s<64> went viral, pun intended. supposed go hospital tests ran, glad changed mind. 
s<65> Airport screening going work due incubation period. know that. work Duncan, insanity. registered vote, think hard America want live in. administration letting problems like ISIS, Russia, Ebola, Enterovirus spiral control will effect America years come. 
s<66> hundreds infectious deceases brought US illegals South America? 
n<67> CDC told Ebola contagious 100% precaution taken prevent spread virus, either know talking just lied. 
s<68> Remember older movie Outbreak, newer ones, Contagion Quarantine? involved theme disease followed quarantine people shot trying escape it. longer Hollywood. 
n<69> Just shows idea many people Duncan may killed lies, time will tell! Still family sees fault dollar signs everywhere else blames everyone else white! anyone recognize doctor nurse came back cured Ebola gone Africa help black people? performing selfless act, selfish act! 
n<70> Yea, 2nd person 'Diagnosed' disease forget minute 0webama IMPORTING many people Ebola! media stopped reporting this. CLUE many infected contagious people here. 
n<71> worker wearing full protective gear contact Duncan, 
s<72> someone sue Samaritan's Purse damn State Department already fault infected African came Miracle cure. brought infected American's back treated serum. publicized world. gave hope African's come cure well. 
s<73> first know anyways... 
n<74> Sadly, Mr. Duncan blame. contact people infected Ebola chose come America. whole situation unfortunate. many people will die people understand importance quarantine? 
s<75> Notice quite obama word. trying think way blame President Bush 
s<76> said press conference was: 
n<77> Almost every average person knew happen. But, CDC said everything control. sounds like average Joe Jane knows truth CDC wants know. 
n<78> begins...the CDC ashamed initial soft pedal approach disease. many people become infected yet know it. 
s<79> Maybe Obama will get another Peace Prize that. 
n<80> Nobody Africa allowed states get handle virus. fever still carry virus, day incubation period. carriers can country long enough infect lot people diagnosed. say flights Africa allowed. CDC wants think can handle it, . 
s<81> feeling worrisome time. feel like practiced nuclear attack high school. scary idea save crawling desk. Obama can escape responsibility this. old school see nation torn apart left wing politics. Protecting kids ebola now racist? Everything upside down. told media wants spin believe eyes. fear lack understanding world leading us war. friends left. obama keeps projecting weakness will drawn real blood guts war. believe obama heart defend country. 
s<82> Obama's plan disrupt November elections? 
s<83> Now everybody contact woman will need b watched, people contact will watched, etc. like AMWAY multi-level marketing pyramid scheme Hell! 
s<84> Obama allow travelers Ebola countries enter America? 
s<85> chatter President said, press releases CDC advising? actual patient care done DOCTORS, politicians. 
s<86> US Obama will restrict air travel African nations Ebola, think Air lines stay away danger flight crews. Pilots stupid, fly even threatened fired. 
s<87> idiot will wind stepping just head Secret Service did. 
n<88> health care administrators seem believe top this. know Ebolia skip certain people wait right DNA come along. real way combat simple hard winter. 
s<89> So, just clarify, lying pos comes Africa, costs us ton money, contaminates American health care worker. God help America. Now soldiers Africa...WHY??? 
s<90> Dr. Thomas Frieden looks talks like someone lost sensibilities. 
n<91> guy ridiculed criticism worry past week Ebola USA spreading? 
n<92> Ebola brought shores people like Mr. Duncan care less American Americans, even count fact someone Africa recently means possible exposure. risk King Obama "punks" CDC keep spouting liberal rhetoric want us believe. 
s<93> sure will cases popping one absolutely mishandled. now coming questionnaire like people sick really going tell truth. Lack solid custom policy might get serious road. 
n<94> just case potential epidemic like seen since 60s, case occurring country (US) dumbed substantially since 60s, incapable understanding interpreting biological information. biologist, fear panic #$%$ ebola. 
n<95> even contain Ebola hospital. hell going contain airports? 
s<96> fight Ebola there, will fight here. 
n<97> anyone really surprised? Remember experts said low risk coming north america. 
s<98> Terrorists watching will exploit weakness, like complete failure response Kobani. need competent leadership. Hey, leadership improvement. 
s<99> Yet another Obama Mouthpiece duck, spin cover... 
n<100> Question is: exactly person become contagious? 
s<101> things like handling money,public restrooms door knobs.i know might sound nuts washing hands 15, times day sure enough.stop 
s<102> Ebola obviously easier contract told. ok that? 
n<103> way stop spread Ebola import people Africa. government said must true. 
s<104> like know Honorable Rev. Al Sharpton's thoughts make decision, whole thing racial overtones it. 
n<105> "The level virus low". CDC's Frieden's comments dangerous misleading. single virus organism infecting host multiplies exponentially. infected victims, regardless level exposure, barely even odds surviving. 
s<106> problem must solved laboratory. solved airport politics. better get cracking. 
s<107> hope political ad showing still yet ANOTHER inept, ignorant decision admin. 
n<108> just proves hard keep infected Ebola even precautions taken. Quarantine affected countries still best option containment. 
n<109> People need highly trained PPE procedures, need anywhere near infected. 
s<110> use military help Africans. Use close borders. side benefit keeps illegLs 
s<111> use military help Africans. Use close borders. side benefit keeps illegLs 
s<112> national news saying read local news another person isolation probably infected pet nurses apartment. 
s<113> Amazingly banning business tourist travelers Passports originated Ebola infected country rash. 
n<114> think second hospital staff follow protocol. environmental department (cleaning) staff another story. hospital absolute worst place care Ebola carriers. secluded place absolute professionals top officials field best way handle isolation patients disease. 
n<115> certain contagious prior getting fever? seems contradict patient still contagious blood stream? 
n<116> need send anyone (to include aid workers, health care workers etc) BACK remote location ban persons, goods, flights, etc there. offense, love family risk lives politically correct goody-goody bs. 
s<117> trust president plan contain ebola. right everything else six years, different? 
s<118> PC, fair countries, especially poor ones, US stopped travel kept disease out. US needs infected too, keep everything fair... 
s<119> Americans quarantine dogs days travel outside country, yet quarantine person coming Africa potentially carrying fatal disease? 
s<120> Obama committing military first nation second, horrible death! 
s<121> Plagues, droughts, famine direct result useful idiots electing sodomite king. Turn back God can expect same. 
s<122> September government started equipping training every body dog catcher. (hospitals) drills handling brakes kinds nasty biologic brakes. tv news covered made big deal showed us people nothing fear. government handing money equipment hospitals put plans place look happens. 
n<123> reported health care worker got Ebola compromised immune system begin with, naturally easy target virus. 
s<124> incompetent here, fear will put us risk. tell texan anyting know everything. careful everyone, careful indeed. 
s<125> Close damn borders!! allow anymore west africans country. big risk take!!! 
s<126> say 4,500 now US came infected areas Africa late Obama threated lives favor brother Muslims. 
s<127> Aids: 0.3% chance contracting percutaneous exposure. Health deteriorates slowly. 
n<128> Consider none people living Duncan sick, none people treated Duncan first visit ER developed disease yet. watch period will end October 19, day passes without symptoms odds will get Ebola get lower lower. 
n<129> seen video's people moving Ebola victims body bags? 
n<130> conservative am, seems stepped sooner attack disease Africa. easy say problem, world getting smaller smaller. 
s<131> Obola promised fundamentally change America, realize wanted kill bunch us process. 
s<132> Guess wars kill'in people fast enough, Globalists pet Progs needed world-wide pandemic really get things going right direction. 
s<133> Texas Health Director David Lakey: 鈥淭his sophisticated city, sophisticated hospital, 鈥? chances spread very, scarce.鈥? 
n<134> one person infected somebody allowed enter USA criminals D.C. Stay tuned folks. policies obviously going spread disease far wide. 
s<135> 'Texas health worker becomes second person diagnosed U.S. Ebola' 
s<136> Ebola rider horse, you, death follows. 
s<137> happens several people low income minority neighborhoods get this? Will shut area off? Will liberals scream racism? Will riots? feel government prepared? 
s<138> going happen military personal start coming back? Bases will shut down? will Army fight anybody with. Hmmmm. Surprised Obama sending weeks tour replacing them. 
s<139> Send aid, institute travel ban fem region. 
n<140> "The virus far ahead us every day situation gets worse," head United Nations' emergency Ebola mission, Anthony Banbury, told UN leaders tour Liberia, Guinea Sierra Leone, nations hardest hit epidemic. 
n<141> may one breach protocol. CDC doctor may contaminated something later touched. Anyone trust CDC political operatives? 
s<142> seem can just crawl hole say, let anyone travel US, matter let US citizen travel country? 
n<143> Yeah know much Ebola people get yet people still getting it. 
s<144> Stay away Liberian #$%$. 
n<145> Good job allowing fly begin with. 
s<146> upon time CDC task, real epidemic since '60s (no, AIDS count), gotten complacent years expanding mission cover hectoring cut amount salt eat (bad advice) amount fat eat (also bad advice) also address "epidemic gun violence" using tax dollars convince voters enact gun control legislation. 
n<147> Texas needs learn Nigeria. managed contain outbreak. 
n<148> state ebola preparedness US gets detected elevated temperature? person known high risk working hospital? Wow! 
n<149> Lets see. cdc says " worry, prepared".. nurse helped take care ebola #1 US takes care people, family members come visit sick families friends, go work school, travel across country World. cdc now comes says " well, knew happen". Really? every living person 1st grade education. 
s<150> ANYTHING administration tells LIE..PROVEN time time again. people lying cover fact Ebola going spread STUPIDEST president ever elected dum'd electorate plays golf fund raises. 
n<151> least test positive dope. 
n<152> Everyone understand just happened. CDC knew worker least since Friday, waited Sunday 3AM attempt bury news. fact, known case well Friday. Liberian Ebola patient Texas (Duncan) first sought treatment September 25th, normal incubation period days, meaning normally known worker October 5th. Instead, days since Duncan's first contact hospital, means incubation period days, uncommon. days THEORETICAL outer limit, quarantine period. 
s<153> trust CDC ! trust World Health Organization U.N. evil agenda rest us sleeves. 
n<154> mutated now airborne. seems explanation people wearing protection still able contract disease. 
n<155> scary many people world anyway. 
s<156> worry folks. Obama Administration Ebola totally control. way can spread United States. fact, POS occupying White House confident that, sent thousands troops stricken areas Africa build shelters, etc Ebola victims. word hell troops it... 
s<157> wonder many exposed worker. worry folks, President Eblola control. 
n<158> healthcare workers risking lives save others, many people can quake fear idea someone near might become infected. obnoxious! 
n<159> trained health care worker wearing full protective gear gets Ebola. say Ebola highly contagious. little bit worried someone telling whole truth here. 
s<160> Since news never reports anymore; wonder many soldiers died today protecting rights free? 
s<161> 'hazmat' suit nothing. hate say this, longer going anywhere to, avoiding anyone looks ill like plague. 
n<162> bad news? Ebola contagious hoped. good news? Maybe will wakeup call brain-dead liberals. 
s<163> Google 'U.S. lacks single standard Ebola response' explains lot 
n<164> Time take extreme measures insure safety health citizens. Acting strongly now offensive act, need bring defense. 
s<165> Yep. Rather isolating disease home country, spread around, isolate it. kind absolute morons charge here? Oh. Liberals. Always stupid. Always getting Americans killed. 
n<166> "This obviously bad news, news bring panic," Jenkins said. Yes, keep calm, carry on, wait Ebola come you. 
n<167> Dr. Frieden practicing first rule politics, deep shlit, blame victim. 
n<168> little perspective consider this. country Nigeria infected 'Obola' just one man, Patrick Sawyer, Liberia (a Liberian-American), ignored advice stay inside home, exposed sister died. time co-workers anxious around sent home told stay there, decided go conference work Nigeria. time flight arrived Liberia, Nigeria, violently ill, July 20, dying days later! 
n<169> ...THIS proof positive Ebola can WILL spread, regardless so-called medical officials, etc. say...We're dealing something TOTALLY realm...We're it...GOOD LUCK... 
n<170> article entitled "Records chronicle Duncan's decline" states: Finally, p.m. Sept. 30, doctors received confirmation dreading: "Patient tested positive Ebola ..." staff attending Duncan traded gowns scrubs hazmat suits attendants scrub room bleach. 
s<171> Chinese building roads (GRATIS, LESS) Central Africa since late 90s. wonder why? Ebola outbreak occurred now, halted several years ago?. natural reoccurence? makes person wonder. heard cases China, home world's largest population? Australia case, Europe and, course AMERICA DOES! Ask yourself, gain potential pandemic. remains isolated, buffered rest world? far stretch. Like said, makes one wonder lot mouths feed there....and dwindling resources. 
n<172> little, late. CDC dragged heals chance stopped disease Liberia July. Now CDC talking privately global "epidemic" "exponential growth". 
s<173> thought zombies will bring us apocalypse, well guess will close enough. 
s<174> US always country waits happens,to react?Happened way back Pearl Harbor,caught totally gaurd there,9-11 another instance,just react happens,then react make country worse place,and now ebola,we reacting months,or even years late. 
n<175> CDC saying actually difficult get disease, nurse wearing protective clothing still contracted disease. either luck really sucks.....or CDC ideal hell talking about..
