n<1>                    Safe removal of the protective gear is the most challenging part of the whole process when one deals with extreme hazards like Ebola. One needs to develop a culture of appreciation of the procedure which comes with repeating it hundreds of times - that's why the miltary from ABC detachments almost never had safety incidents. My suggestion would be for anyone who is to be assigned to the Ebola treatment to practice de-gowning (supervised) at least 20 times. As this requires at least 8-10 hrs of [paid] time, I guess the hospital saved on the training - now they will spend a million caring for the poor nurse.
n<1>                        the person who got the Ebola (per news conference) was considered a low risk contact.
s<2>                        This is America man, we don't wanna pay for some training.  We'll just complain about it later instead of giving someone a proper training/living wage.
s<3>                        Bob stands for Big Ole Blowhard.
s<4>                        I'm glad you know what abbreviations are.  Here's a big gold star sticker for you.
n<2>                    She only stopped working two days ago ? They need to stop treating this like a bad cold and get serious. How many people has she had contact with in a clinical setting. Further more they continue to repeat the same thing about how to contract the virus. In a recent article in the LA times the original scientist who discovered Ebola said the virus is to new to really say that we know all the ways it's spread, he would not rule out the fact it may be air born.
s<5>                        She is a terrorist and knows it!
n<6>                        It only makes thing worse to spread scary "they say" information and "maybe" information, instead of listening to reality and actually acting on that instead of running around in terror like a chicken with its head cut off, Dan.  You might want to read up a bit on incubation periods and how that effects how disease is spread.
s<3>                    Dr Frieden needs to step down. He is not trustworthy and has proven so by his comments and his non-action on this serious situation. People across this country has better get out there and start demanding these deadly situations be handled instead of BS EXCUSES. I don't care who gets their feelings hurt because of stopping flights into our country. I DO NOT CARE PERIOD. They are not my concern. We can get healthcare workers who VOLUNTEER to go to Africa on private or government planes. But keep them out of the US! This is OUR country.  And I for one have had this #$%$ pushed down my throat for far too long. Get the damned ISIS supporters out too. If they want to support them then send their stupid a**es over there permanently. Peoples personal rights should end when they assist criminals period! 
n<4>                    How can this be?  It should be unpossible!  I mean both the president and the CDC said there was nothing to worry about from Ebola.  Of course this is the same group that took something like 5 days to set up a quarantine of the Dallas Ebola victims apartment - an apartment he had been sick in and vomited violently in and around - and which people wandered in and out of.  To paraphrase another president, "Heck of a job your doin' there CDC."
s<7>                        If you believe anything from Big Cheif Lying Lips, then you are a lost soul.
s<8>                        Ha! you trust anything the govt says?? Dont. there is no truth to be coming out of ANY politicians mouth.
n<5>                    When are these idiots going to realize and admit to the heavy evidence that this is a surface contaminant organism that is transmissible similar to the way that the Hepatitis viruses are transmitted.  I spent 20 years working in the field of infectious diseases, some of that time was spent at Presbyterian Hosp. in Dallas.  This is a top-flight institution with excellent nursing and ancillary staff.  The blame rests squarely on CDC and their insistence on not restricting travel from countries where the disease is epidemic.  Their brand of containment will only serve to spread this disease.
s<9>                        Well, somebody certainly has a vivid imagination. Why do you feel the need to fabricate bullschit, have you no integrity?
n<10>                        frugal : "when are they going to realize . . ."   Heads up!  Alert, alert!  They do realize it.  Don't think this is not deliberate introduction of Obola into America.  This is all about research dollars for big pharmaceuticals and BIG timely distraction/crisis for Obola administration.  Remember, he has only 2 years remaining to fulfill his handiwork.
n<11>                        Knowing nothing about the transmission of disease, I can tell you from personal experience with dust and aerosol organics, those cheesy elastic masks do very, very little to stop air born matter from entering your body. They need better protocol for aerosols.
s<12>                        BO is the ffff  evil aaaa hole who refused to defend Americans not the corrupt CDC.. 
s<13>                        fffff you democrats=======ebola ain't no fff game  
s<14>                        Are all you republicans crazy?  Im a Canadian, so I have no political horse in any race, so im not grandstanding. I refuse to listen to you nuts who think Obama would intentionally let this spread! To even say it is irresponsible, and just plain stupid!
s<15>                        MR == BO had the power to stop people from the death zones  from entering this nation and he fff refused thus it was an intentional evil and unforgivable act. 
s<16>                        Mr. Gray, the republican party panders to anti-intellectuals, they actually try to foster that type of thinking. As far as the republicans are concerned the dumber the republican voter is... the better.
s<17>                        No2Party: You are clearly lacking Vitamin B ('B' for brain).
s<18>                        Just imagine the chaos and death if Duncan had taken a stroll in some crowded Dallas shopping mall prior to his hospital visit. The do-gooder missionaries or whoever funded his air travel to the states should be prosecuted. 
n<6>                    You need (old time "live agent trained") military chemical and Biological instructors to train medical people how to decontaminate properly, as it is evident that the medical method is not doing the job. I guess everyone believes that old saying "We are medical professionals and we know what we are doing" vs. I am a specialist/technician trained in decontamination of Chemical, biological and Nuclear contamination as my everyday job to protect the Military and Civilians; we are not medical Doctors.  They treat injuries and illness; I prevent them by removing the hazard.  Just my observations.
s<7>                    HELLO - it's called a pandemic boys - a big one . Now start treating it as such instead of the Mickey Mouse** games you have been playing with everyone's lives.  Oh wait. these are Government workers -- they don't know any better - they think they do, but they really don't. No surprise there. 
n<8>                    I can't blame any particular entity in this debacle but certainly our cockiness in healthcare system is something to examine. Doctors and CDC doctors in particular, who haven't encountered a case of an exotic disease tell us that they know all there is to know about it and can protect us absolutely. This new patient, a nurse put her trust in their hyperbolic statements and now could end up paying the ultimate price. Some of these people at CDC and in the administration need to eat the humble pie in public but don't hold your breath. They know it all and will tell you that it is OK to let people who are exposed to Ebola in W Africa to come streaming into this country. It is no problem.
n<9>                    There is no way this isn't spreading in some other way. You have people that SPECIALIZE in the medical field getting this like a common cold.
n<10>                    In a White House Press Corpse briefing President Obama said, "If you like your Ebola you can keep your Ebola."    Fox New's Ed Henry hammered the President with questions that others in the corpse later said were "not appropriate" for a free press.  After pressing the President on why he refused to block entry of people with passports from  Liberia and other West Aftican countries Mr. Obama seemed to lose patience with Mr. Henry and others in the room who apparently did not understand his brilliance.  "Look, Fox News likes to get their viewers riled up about this stuff. but uh. well  you know  there's not a smidgen of Ebola in Washington and there isn't likely to be any reported before the elections. The simple fact is that quarantines don't work."
n<11>                    Why people should want to help! In the 1980's I had just begun my nursing career and AIDS/HIV epidemic was entering the states. I worked on the oncology unit and this is where patients affected with HIV were sent. I wasn't 20 years old yet. I remember other hospital staff refusing to gown up to take care of this patient, but I volunteered too! He was only 25 years old and not even his own family would come see him because they were worried that they could be affected! I would go visit him after my shift and just sit in his room with him visiting about his life and how scared he was since even the hospital staff didn't spend anymore time in his room than needed. He finally asked me one day why was I not fearful of getting HIV from him. I said I made the choice to take care of people no matter what the outcome may be. The reason I spent so much time with him was I realized... What if this was one of my family members or friends? Would I want the people I entrusted to care for them to turn their back out of fear? The answer for me was NO! I can't and will not turn my back in someone else's time of need if I can help them. In less than 9 months I watched this young man wither up and looked as if he was in his 70's before he died. But in my heart he knew he wasn't alone, I made sure of that. Although many of you are worried about the what if's .... You need to live for today. I also did not mind owning up to go see him anytime because he wasn't able to leave that room but I was. So please think about not only the illness but also the isolation these EBOLA patients are going through now. If it was you or your family member could you honestly walk away!
s<12>                   ""PRESIDENT EBOLA: In 2010 Obama Administration Scrapped CDC Quarantine Regulations Aimed At Ebola""
s<13>                    Where is the U.N.? Why is our military being sent to Africa. Let the U.N. send people. Our Military is already cut to the bare bones and now they are suppose to risk their own lives for this? The rest of the world needs to kick in some help. STOP ALL FLIGHTS from that part of Africa and do not let anyone who has a passport from those countries come here. Have our "leaders" just completely lost their minds?
n<14>                    There was not protocol lapses. Mr. Duncan said he visited west Africa. What he should have told them is that he was in direct contact with a very seriously ill woman with Ebola. He also should have told the Liberian officials of his exposure, as well. This would have triggered better health care, not only for him but for all that were exposed. Instead, we have a family that wants to blame the hospital when it was not the hospitals or health care workers fault. Nurses and hospital staff are there to help his #$%$, not kiss it!
n<15>                    As far as the funding goes, our media keeps talking about it being underfunded... but if you go on Africa news website, and click on the different countries affected, etc. they are saying the UN , amongst other countries, including the US , have funded billions of dollars--- not just a 1 billion pledge, from the UN.    
s<16>                    How you need to deal with Ebola/Marburg. It's not a new thing, maybe to you it is.
s<17>                    and how many folks did this nurse treat before she figured out she had a low grade fever? You think the hospital gave her paid time off after treating this patient? Seriously? ...we have knuckleheads at the CDC and sitting in the white house..this could get very bad before it gets better...if this spreads - I know I won't be showing up at a clinic/hospital unless its in the e/r and I am on my deathbed. can you imagine going to a grocery store, church, a bank etc and having people hack out a lung everywhere....
s<18>                    I think this disease is just getting started and before it is done it will claim many more lives than it already has....The CDC let this happen...it could have been prevented...Africa is full of disease and as long as it is allowed to exsist in its current state this will continue to happen...If I am not mistaken Africa is also the birth place of AIDS...Look how many people have been infected by it on a global scale
n<19>                    "We don't know what occurred in the care of the index patient, the original patient, in Dallas, but at some point there was a breach in protocol, and that breach in protocol resulted in this infection," CDC director Dr. Thomas Frieden told a news conference. - R U F'in kidding me? Will someone PLEASE FIRE this MORON!!! They don't know what occurred but something occurred...OBVIOUSLY!!! More then 300 healthcare worker IN the Ebola infected nations, one in Spain and now in the US have gotten it. I think they have NO idea how it's spreading. Stop people from that region coming here. CLOSE THE BORDERS! and Quarantine EVERYONE who came in contact here until they are TOTALLY A-symptomatic. We are in a really bad situation right now because the the people in charge have NO IDEA. Time to fire them and get people in who will do it right.
n<20>                    Ebola survivor Nancy Writebol also doesn't know how she got the virus:
s<21>                    An Ebola/Marburg Zombie boards a bus, and sits in the back, in the middle back seat. 
n<22>                    She only stopped working two days ago ? They need to stop treating this like a bad cold and get serious. How many people has she had contact with in a clinical setting. Further more they continue to repeat the same thing about how to contract the virus. In a recent article in the LA times the original scientist who discovered Ebola said the virus is to new to really say that we know all the ways it's spread, he would not rule out the fact it may be air born.
n<23>                    So ebola is so hard to spread that trained health care workers are catching it.
s<24>                    Dr Frieden needs to step down. He is not trustworthy and has proven so by his comments and his non-action on this serious situation. People across this country has better get out there and start demanding these deadly situations be handled instead of BS EXCUSES. I don't care who gets their feelings hurt because of stopping flights into our country. I DO NOT CARE PERIOD. They are not my concern. We can get healthcare workers who VOLUNTEER to go to Africa on private or government planes. But keep them out of the US! This is OUR country.  And I for one have had this #$%$ pushed down my throat for far too long. Get the damned ISIS supporters out too. If they want to support them then send their stupid a**es over there permanently. Peoples personal rights should end when they assist criminals period! 
n<25>                    The research of Drs. Ron Fouchier and Yoshihiro Kawaoka looked at making bird flu evolve into a super flu spread by air and animals back in 2011. Previously, you mainly got H5n1 or H7N9 by being in close contact with infected birds. It was not person to person. They were able to achieve air borne status in H5N1 virus by genetically modifying it. They used Ferrets as the host and in 10 evolution, they did what mother nature would likely have taken maybe hundreds of years to do because they wanted to prove that if they can do it in the lab, mother nature can do it too, Of course you see the logic in that rational, right?
n<26>                    Sure sounds like Ebola can be airborne and that respirators should be used in place of simple face shields. Since protocols are being followed by this medical worker and the Spanish nurse who both contracted it why avoid the idea of air transmission?  Liberia's head doctor got it early on after meticulously following protocols.  The protocols have the hole and one big hole is not having a respirator on at all times. Obama should stop the inflights of 150 West Africans per day. Each is a potential ticking time bomb being imported.  And the placebo screening methods put in place of a thermometer in a mouth are extremely weak given the 21 day period to become symptomatic. The Japanese have developed a 30 minute Ebola test which for about $500 would tell or traveler if he's safe to board or not. Without strong screening measures they shouldn't be flying here in the first place. Especially given the fact that no viable treatment cure is widely available yet. This exposure to our population is unacceptable by a POTUS.
s<27>                    鈥淒on鈥檛 touch the walls!鈥? a Western medical technician yelled out. 鈥淭otally infected.鈥?
n<28>                    This is why we need a travel ban immediately to the US from West Africa, and we need to detain and return all illegal border crossings.  This case would not have happened if Duncan had been denied a visa. The arguments against a civilian travel ban are erroneous. Travelers can be tracked and visas restricted. Aid can continue to flow into West Africa and aid workers seeking to return can be placed in quarantine for a safe period, and monitored when they return. Pretty soon, if there are more cases of Ebola in the US as a result of this administration's irresponsible containment strategy we will not be able to track and monitor all of the contacts and the potentially infected. The expense to do so will skyrocket. And our ability to help West Africa will diminish as we will be consumed with the disease here in the US. The CDC position on not recommending a travel ban is outrageous. They have now put many innocent Americans at risk, and now this healthcare workers life is in the balance. The "know it all" CDC and the administration first repeatedly assured that first Ebola will not reach our shores, and then assured that it can be contained. They are being proved wrong with each statement that they are "fully confident" that precautions are sufficient.
s<29>                    Nurses have been screaming about this for years so maybe this is a good time to remind hospitals about medical errors!!!!!!  Hundreds of people are KILLED every day in the U.S. due to medical errors because nurses are afraid to report a breach in protocol due to retaliation.  Just because you have a policy that states retaliation is not allowed does NOT mean that  it does not happen.  I'm going to guess that someone didn't follow protocol and possibly someone saw it but was afraid to report it.
s<30>                    To My Government:
s<31>                    In a White House Press Corpse briefing President Obama said, "If you like your Ebola you can keep your Ebola."    Fox New's Ed Henry hammered the President with questions that others in the corpse later said were "not appropriate" for a free press.  After pressing the President on why he refused to block entry of people with passports from  Liberia and other West Aftican countries Mr. Obama seemed to lose patience with Mr. Henry and others in the room who apparently did not understand his brilliance.  "Look, Fox News likes to get their viewers riled up about this stuff. but uh. well  you know  there's not a smidgen of Ebola in Washington and there isn't likely to be any reported before the elections. The simple fact is that quarantines don't work."
n<32>                    I'm sorry, but nothing the CDC or our president says gives me confidence that we can handle Ebola. There have been so many failures in our federal institutions, particularly recently with the VA, that I just don't think Americans can rely on what they do or say. This is a public health emergency and Obama had the authority and responsibility to stop any Ebola victim from entering the US.  Ebola has been in Africa for decades. It's not new. But what IS new is its introduction into the US.
s<33>                    The do-gooder missionaries who funded Duncan's air travel to the states should be prosecuted for bio-terrorism.  What makes and infected person, like Duncan, any less dangerous to Americans than Islamo-terrorists?   Had Duncan taken a stroll in a crowded Dallas shopping mall there would be utter chaos and pandemonium in Texas today. 
s<34>                    This is the time for the annual trip to Mecca. Saudi Arabia had the sense to declare NO PEOPLE FROM PLAGUE INFESTED COUNTRIES ALLOWED, PERIOD! Why are the leaders of Saudi Arabia smarter than those (Democrat politicians) currently leading the USA? Yes, America's stature has fallen, especially in the last 6 years! Now, who is it that is currently in charge doing this damage....? In less than 3 weeks you can change that while insisting that the USA be secured using ALL measures on the table, that includes halting all VISAS and securing our borders while halting flights from plague zones. Anyone seeking to enter the USA (legally) must be quarantined 21 days at both ends, there and then here. If there were ever a reason to halt illegal entry, terrorism and Obola come to mind, now is the time!
n<35>                    Protocols are supposed to be robust enough to compensate for human failures.  So far the protocols have not worked in Texas.  So far the media has accepted vague and hazy pronouncements from officials.  Just now on Face the Nation the CDC would commit to nothing about what we've learned and how we are going to improve protocols.  He evaded even the question of how many are now being observed by stating it is only 12 hours old and he doesn't have an exact number.  I'd be interested to know if it was greater or less than a dozen or some other range but this type of (lack of) information only fuels peoples imaginations and increases (hopefully) needless fear.
n<36>                    In Liberia, well trained people in level 4 containment suits routinely get Ebola and die. Our hospitals give the nurses gloves and surgical masks. There was no "breakdown in protocols." THERE WAS NO PROTOCOL. [What do you think the housekeepers were wearing after the first visit?]This administration is doing all it can to bring ebola to America, refusing to stop flights from west Africa [that would be RACIST, is there excuse, I'm sure. It is for every other thing they do to try to bring down this country] Now they assure us that this new case didn't pass it on to others, when obviously they have no way of actually knowing that, and won't know for a month at the minimum. This disease, if loosed in one project house in downtown Dallas, could easily kill more people than we lost on 9-11, and cost exponentially more than the Obama's stole for Michelle's friend and the Solyndra swindel combined, and yet every day a jet lands in JFK, direct from Africa. This administration just sent thousands of our troops to the area. Do you think there are any plans to quarantine them when they get back. I'd bet NO, unless we raise all kinds of noise and force it to happen. Call your congressman and demand they close the borders, stop the flights, and quarantine everyone who has been over there. The risks are enormous
s<37>                    This is the diversity that we've been preached about for the last 40 years coming home to roost.&nbsp;
n<38>                    Health care workers are the ones who have to handle all those bed sheets and clothing worn by the infected person. They do all the menial, messy chores that the doctors won't do. If that person is not aware that the infectious agent is Ebola, then it's not a surprise that the first victim of an Ebola patient would be a health care worker. It appears that early on, no one was aware of Mr. Duncan's true condition. Now somebody is paying a high price for that - and there could be more to come.
n<39>                    Obama MUST accept the fact that the so-called "enhanced screening" he put into effect would not have stopped the late Mr Duncan, since he was not showing symptoms when he arrived in the US.  In addition, if Mr Duncan had been honest in Liberia and told the screener the truth about recent contact with; the sick Liberian lady, he would have never arrived on our shores.  If a travel ban from Ebola hotspots saves even one American life, it is worth it!  My request is for an honest US government effort to try to screen and IMPLEMENT A TRAVEL BAN for anyone who has travelled either directly, or by connecting flights, from Ebola pandemic nations.
n<40>                    The only breach in procedure was the US allowing these ebola patients to come in. This joker who is the director of the CDC has to go because all he wants to do is blame health workers for things that they don't even know. The government wanted this disease to outbreak in the US. They know their reasons, now they're trying to blame everybody else but themselves. All the nurses should let the doctors and the so-called specialists take care of the patients and let's see how that goes. This is just sick how the government is killing our own people.Time to buy a FEMA coffin.
s<41>                    LOL I keep telling y'all that the plagues mentioned in Revelation are being poured out on to this sinful world. Blaming the president, ebola, police, islamists, christians, the easter bunny, your old nasty neighbor or anyone is not the answer and is not going to save you. Scripture clearly states that NONE shall escape the judgement in this time! Stop hating, humble yourselves, leave your bigotries and sinful ways. Maybe the Lord will have mercy on you!!!
s<42>                    Angry? I'm livid! Protect our borders! Stop all VISAS &amp; flights from infected plague zones IMMEDIATELY! And remove every illegal alien from our shores that has come in the last 20 years (for good measure), especially the illegal minors now bringing this polio-like illness (since school started) to where ever they go (President 'Obola' distributed them to EVERY SINGLE STATE, all 57 of them)! Vote out the current crop in November and cast your vote for the MOST conservative, since they are likely to 'do the right thing', which is to protect the USA from enemies "FOREIGN and DOMESTIC" (which NOW includes President 'Obola')!
s<43>                    Mr. Duncan had red eyes, a dead giveaway that it could be Ebola/Marburg since he just 
s<44>                    Under control? Sept 16..Obama.."First and foremost, I want the American people to know that our experts, here at the CDC and across our government, agree that the chances of an Ebola outbreak here in the United States are extremely low. We鈥檝e been taking the necessary precautions, including working with countries in West Africa to increase screening at airports so that someone with the virus doesn鈥檛 get on a plane for the United States"... Now, feel safer?
s<45>                    From an interview after the screenings.
s<46>                    From WHO
s<47>                    You have nothing to fear except the government itself.
s<48>                    Interesting how nations that are next door to the Ebola zones have successfully stopped the virus at their borders and yet the US which is an Ocean away is seeing Ebola problems already.  Something is not right about this picture.
n<49>                    Healthcare workers providing bedside care come into contact with all body fluids and waste products. Under these conditions there is no protocol that can guarantee 100% safety of not being exposed.
s<50>                    If anyone was considering moving away from the big city for a slower, more relaxed way of life in the country NOW IS THE TIME.
s<51>                    given the erosion so quickly of our civil rights guaranteed under the US Constitution [RIP habeas corpus] it is indeed surprising that the CDC with the backing of Homeland Security did not do more to make sure this disease did not come to this country.  our civil rights eroded and destroyed but god forbid that a traveler be stopped at the border or not allowed entry because, of course, commerce is more important than public safety.
n<52>                    Well I wonder what Mr. Duncan's family has to say now about someone who volunteered to care for a man who lied about being exposed and entered the US and then didn't even have the decency to say I was exposed to Ebola. Sure he told them he had been in Liberia, but failed to say he had cared for someone with Ebola.  His family disgusts me, trying to pull the race card. They should be held responsible for the cost of his care, the financial loss of the hospital (no longer excepting emergency room patients) and the cost of decontamination of all past, current and future costs associated to fighting Ebola in the US. Maybe that would shut them up. While we are at it, let's send that mouth piece Jesse Jackson to Liberia and strap him down to a bed that an Ebola patient recently died in. I'm so sick of him and Al Sharpton creating hate and discontent, so they can push their political agendas. Close our boarders to anyone coming from an infected country unless they have spent 21 days in isolation. Before the democrats and liberals start whining about my comments, I am a registered democrat. These days I'm siding with the right and feel a fool for the way I voted in the last election.
s<53>                    Obama is the worst president in history. I have a college degree in history, im not an evangelical, I'm a regular american who leans conservative. But Obama is a disaster for the middle class and does not promote the greatness that this country has. Obama is very much a communist and lives in the past. Obama believes in making up for the SINS of colonialism. Obama is worst than jimmy carter and Woodrow wilson
s<54>                    And we are sending out military to help in Africa?
n<55>                    Did anyone ask if she was in contact with him the first time he came into the hospital and how many people did he come into contact with in the two days after the hospital turn him away the first time.  It's time we do not allow anyone into our country who has traveled to Africa or who has been on a flights that connected travelers from Africa.  This should have been done a long time ago.  Where is our leader and commander and chief?  Where is the CDC?  I blame them for this.  Another failure and lack of action.  This is going to spread like wild fire and some of us are going to say I told you so.  Wake up.  Time to work harder on a vaccine.  Mr. President, Where is your leadership?
s<56>                    FALSE FLAG TERRORISM .  Who is this new ISIS?  Where did this EBOLA crisis suddenly come in?  FALSE FLAG= When a government gets back in the corner, create a CRISIS to change the tide.. Cover up the truth as to what they are REALLY doing..
n<57>                    Had Dr. Friedan and the people who supposedly run this country kept the ORIGINAL Ebola protocols in place, this poor woman would not be facing this battle now. Close the borders, and demand accountability from the CDC and our government!
s<58>                    Travel Ban on anywhere to Africa and completely close the southern border.  Whomever is currently there will have to undergo 30 days of isolation with rigorous monitoring and make 100 certain they are clear before we allow them into the US, Cancel all shipments from Africa, That is the only way to stop it.
n<59>                    It's apparent the CDC protocols are not sufficient. I suspect the entire medical community, including the CDC, knows just about as much about Ebola as they did about the Black Death in the Middle Ages.
s<60>                    The hubris of humankind - "Oh we know how to control outbreaks, so it's OK".
s<61>                    Isn't it special that the US public is being used as lab rats for the great experiment of testing out Frieden's political correctness and Obama's liberal, progressive immigration policies?
s<62>                    Could Obama have stopped the flights from Ebola countries?
s<63>                    Another Obama failure. Ebola should never have been brought to the U.S. And once he made that decision, he and the folks in his administration that came up with these protocols are to blame if they didn't work.
s<64>                    It's went viral, no pun intended. I was supposed to go to that hospital to have some tests ran, glad I changed my mind.
s<65>                    Airport screening is not going to work due to the incubation period. They know that. It did not work with Duncan, this is insanity. If you are registered to vote, think hard about the America you want to live in. This administration is letting problems like ISIS, Russia, Ebola, and Enterovirus 68 spiral out of control and it will effect America for years to come.
s<66>                    and how about the hundreds of infectious deceases that are brought into the US by illegals from South America?
n<67>                    When CDC told you that Ebola is not that contagious and 100% precaution are taken to prevent the spread of the virus, they either don't know what they are talking about or they just lied.
s<68>                    Remember the older movie Outbreak, or how about the newer ones, Contagion and Quarantine? Each involved a theme of disease followed by quarantine and people were shot trying to escape it. It's no longer Hollywood.
n<69>                    Just shows that we have no idea how many people Duncan may have killed with his lies, only time will tell! Still the family sees fault and dollar signs everywhere else and blames everyone else who is white!  Does anyone recognize that the doctor and nurse who came back and were cured would not have had Ebola had they not gone to Africa to help black people? They were performing a selfless act, not a selfish act!
n<70>                    Yea, he is the 2nd person 'Diagnosed' here with the disease - Don't forget for a minute that 0webama is IMPORTING many people with Ebola! The media has stopped reporting on this. We have NO CLUE how many infected contagious people are here.
n<71>                    The worker was wearing full protective gear when in contact with Duncan, 
s<72>                    Would someone sue Samaritan's Purse and the damn State Department already it is their fault the infected African came here for a Miracle cure. They brought the infected American's back here to be treated with a serum. Which was publicized all over the world. Then it gave hope to African's to come here for a cure as well.
s<73>                    The first that we know of anyways...
n<74>                    Sadly, Mr. Duncan is to blame.  He was in contact with people infected with Ebola and chose to come to America.   The whole situation is unfortunate.  How many people will die before people understand the importance of quarantine?
s<75>                    Notice how quite obama has been not a word. He most be trying to think of a way to blame President Bush
s<76>                    All that was said at this press conference was:
n<77>                    Almost every average person knew this could and would happen. But, the CDC said they had everything under control. It sounds like the average Joe or Jane knows more about the truth than the CDC wants them to know.
n<78>                    And so it begins...the CDC should be ashamed for their initial soft pedal approach to this disease.  How many people have become infected by those who don't yet know they have it.
s<79>                    Maybe Obama will get another Peace Prize for that.
n<80>                    Nobody from Africa should be allowed into the states until they get a handle on the virus. If you don't have a fever you could still carry the virus, it has a 21 day incubation period. The carriers can be in this country long enough to infect a lot of people before they are diagnosed. I say no flights from Africa allowed. The CDC wants you to think they can handle it, they can't .
s<81>                    I am feeling we are in a very worrisome time. I feel like I did when we practiced for nuclear attack at high school. It was a scary idea we could save ourselves by crawling under a desk. Obama can not escape his responsibility for this. I am old school so I see we are a nation being torn apart by left wing politics. Protecting my kids from ebola is now racist? Everything is upside down. We are told what the media wants to spin and not to believe our own eyes. I fear this lack of understanding of the world is leading us to war. We have no friends left. If obama keeps projecting weakness we will be drawn into a real blood and guts war. I don't believe obama has the heart to defend our country.
s<82>                    Could this be Obama's plan to disrupt the November elections?
s<83>                    Now everybody who has been in contact with this woman will need to b watched, and then the people they've been in contact will be watched, etc. It's like the AMWAY multi-level marketing pyramid scheme from Hell!
s<84>                    Why did Obama allow travelers from Ebola countries to enter America?
s<85>                    What is all this chatter about what the President said, or what press releases from the CDC are advising?  The actual patient care is being done by DOCTORS, not politicians.
s<86>                    If the US and Obama will not restrict air travel from the African nations with Ebola, I would think that the Air lines would stay away because of the danger to the flight crews. Pilots are not stupid, I wouldn't fly there even if threatened with being fired.
s<87>                    This idiot will wind up stepping down just as the head of the Secret Service did.
n<88>                    These health care administrators seem to believe that there on top of this. For all they know Ebolia could skip certain people and wait for the right DNA to come along. The only real way to combat this could be as simple as a hard winter.
s<89>                    So, just to clarify, the lying pos comes here from Africa, costs us a ton of money, and contaminates an American health care worker. God help America. Now we have 3000 soldiers in Africa...WHY???
s<90>                    This Dr. Thomas Frieden looks and talks like someone who has lost all sensibilities.
n<91>                    wasn't this the same guy that ridiculed the criticism and worry this past week about Ebola in the USA spreading?
n<92>                    With Ebola being brought to our shores by people like Mr. Duncan who could care less about American and Americans, we can't even count on the fact that someone was in Africa recently as a means for possible exposure.  We are all at risk and King Obama and his "punks" at the CDC keep spouting the same liberal rhetoric that they want us to believe.
s<93>                    I am sure that there will be more cases popping up as this one was absolutely mishandled. Only now they coming up with some questionnaire like people who are sick are really going to tell the truth. Lack of solid custom policy might get serious down the road.
n<94>                    This is not just a case of a potential epidemic like we've not seen since the 60s, it's a case of it occurring on a country (US) that has dumbed down substantially since the 60s, and is incapable of understanding and interpreting biological information.  As a biologist, I fear the panic of our #$%$ more than ebola.
n<95>                    If they can't even contain Ebola in a hospital. How the hell are they going to contain it at airports?
s<96>                    If we don't fight Ebola over there, we will have to fight it over here.
n<97>                    Is anyone really surprised?  Remember how the experts said there was a very low risk of it coming to north america.
s<98>                    Terrorists are watching and will exploit any weakness, like this or the complete failure in response to Kobani.  We need competent leadership.  Hey, any leadership at all would be an improvement.
s<99>                    Yet another Obama Mouthpiece that has to duck, spin and cover...
n<100>                    The Question is: When exactly does a person become contagious?
s<101>                    what about things like handling money,public restrooms and door knobs.i know this might sound nuts but i've been washing my hands 15, 20 times a day and i'm not sure that's enough.stop
s<102>                    Ebola is obviously easier to contract than you've been told.  Are you ok with that?
n<103>                    The only way to stop the spread of Ebola is to import more people from Africa.  That is what our government said so it must be true.
s<104>                    I would like to know what the Honorable Rev. Al Sharpton's thoughts are on this before I make a decision, because the whole thing has racial overtones to it.
n<105>                    "The level of virus is low". CDC's Frieden's comments are dangerous and misleading. A single virus organism infecting a host multiplies exponentially. The infected victims, regardless of the level of exposure, have barely even odds of surviving.
s<106>                    This problem must be solved in a laboratory.  It cannot be solved in an airport or with politics.  We better get cracking.
s<107>                    I hope there's a political ad showing still yet ANOTHER inept, ignorant decision by this admin.
n<108>                    This just proves how hard it is to keep from being infected by Ebola even when precautions are taken.  Quarantine of the affected countries is still the best option for containment.
n<109>                    People need to be highly trained with PPE procedures, or they do not need to be anywhere near the infected.
s<110>                    Don't use our military to help Africans. Use it to close our borders. As a side benefit it keeps out illegLs
s<111>                    Don't use our military to help Africans. Use it to close our borders. As a side benefit it keeps out illegLs
s<112>                    what national news is not saying but I read it on the local news is that there is another person in isolation probably infected and a pet in nurses apartment.
s<113>                    Amazingly banning business and tourist travelers with Passports that originated from Ebola infected country is rash.
n<114>                    Don't think for a second that hospital staff follow protocol.  The environmental department (cleaning) staff is another story. A hospital is the absolute worst place to care for Ebola carriers. A secluded place with absolute professionals and top officials in the field is the best way to handle isolation of the patients and disease.
n<115>                    how are they certain that you aren't contagious prior to getting the fever?  that seems to contradict how the patient is still contagious until its out of their blood stream?
n<116>                    We need to send anyone from there (to include the aid workers, health care workers etc) BACK THERE or some remote location and ban all persons, goods, flights, etc from there. No offense, but I love my family and would not risk their lives for some politically correct goody-goody bs.
s<117>                    I trust the president in his plan to contain ebola.  He has been right on everything else for six years, why would this be any different?
s<118>                    To be PC, it wouldn't be fair to other countries, especially the poor ones, if the US stopped travel and kept the disease out. The US needs to be infected too, to keep everything fair...
s<119>                    Americans have to quarantine their dogs for 30 days if they travel outside of the country, yet they can't quarantine a person coming from Africa potentially carrying a fatal disease?
s<120>                    Obama is committing our military first and our nation second, to a horrible death!
s<121>                    Plagues, droughts, famine are a direct result of the useful idiots electing a sodomite as there king. Turn your back on God you can expect the same.
s<122>                    after September 11 2001 the government started equipping and training every body and the dog catcher.  they (hospitals)  had drills for handling out brakes of all kinds of nasty biologic out brakes.  the tv news covered made a big deal and showed us the people we had nothing to fear.  the government was handing out money to equipment the hospitals put plans in place  look what happens.
n<123>                    It was reported that this health care worker who got Ebola had a compromised immune system to begin with, so naturally she was an easy target for the virus.
s<124>                    They are so incompetent down here, I fear that they will put us all at risk. You can't tell a texan anyting they know everything. Be very careful everyone, very careful indeed.
s<125>                    Close the damn borders!!  Don't allow anymore west africans into our country.  It's too big a risk to take!!!
s<126>                    Some say 4,500 are now in the US that came from infected areas of Africa -  To late Obama has threated our lives again in favor of his brother Muslims. 
s<127>                    Aids: 0.3% chance of contracting after percutaneous exposure. Health deteriorates slowly.
n<128>                    Consider this - none of the people who were living with Duncan while he was sick, and none of the people who treated Duncan on his first visit to the ER have developed the disease yet. Their watch period will end October 19, and with each day that passes without symptoms the odds that they will get Ebola get lower and lower.
n<129>                    Have you seen the video's of people moving the Ebola victims in body bags?  
n<130>                    As conservative as I am, It seems we should have stepped up sooner to attack the disease in Africa.  It's easy to say it's their problem, but the world is getting smaller and smaller.
s<131>                    Obola promised he would  fundamentally change America, I didn't realize he wanted to kill a bunch of us in the process.
s<132>                    Guess all the wars weren't kill'in people fast enough, the Globalists and their pet Progs needed a world-wide pandemic to really get things going in the right direction.
s<133>                    Texas Health Director David Lakey: 鈥淭his is a very sophisticated city, a very sophisticated hospital, 鈥? and the chances of it being spread are very, very scarce.鈥?
n<134>                    That's one person infected by somebody allowed to enter the USA by these criminals in D.C.  Stay tuned folks.  Their policies are obviously going to spread this disease far and wide.
s<135>                    'Texas health worker becomes second person diagnosed in U.S. with Ebola'
s<136>                    Ebola is a rider on a horse, you, and death follows.
s<137>                    What happens if several people in low income minority neighborhoods get this?   Will they have to shut that area off?   Will liberals scream racism?  Will there be riots?   Do you feel our government is prepared?
s<138>                    So what's going to happen when the military personal start coming back? Bases will have to be shut down? We will not have an Army to fight anybody with. Hmmmm. Surprised Obama is not sending them over there to do a few weeks tour and then replacing them.
s<139>                    Send aid, but institute a travel ban fem the region.
n<140>                    "The virus is far ahead of us and every day the situation gets worse," the head of the United Nations' emergency Ebola mission, Anthony Banbury, told UN leaders after a tour of Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, the nations hardest hit by the epidemic.
n<141>                    She may not have been the one to breach protocol. Some CDC doctor may have contaminated something that she later touched. Anyone trust these CDC political operatives?
s<142>                    Doesn't seem you can just crawl in a hole and say, don't let anyone travel to the US, or for that matter don't let US citizen travel out of the country?
n<143>                    Yeah they know so much about Ebola and how people get it yet people are still getting it.
s<144>                    Stay away from Liberian #$%$.
n<145>                    Good job for allowing them to fly here to begin with.
s<146>                    Once upon a time the CDC was up to the task, but we haven't had a real epidemic since the '60s (no, AIDS doesn't count), so they've gotten complacent after years of expanding their mission to cover hectoring you to cut down the amount of salt you eat (bad advice) and the amount of fat you eat (also bad advice) and also to address the "epidemic of gun violence" by using tax dollars to convince voters to enact gun control legislation.
n<147>                    Texas needs to learn from Nigeria.  They managed to contain their outbreak.
n<148>                    So is this the state of ebola preparedness in the US that it gets detected by elevated temperature? And in a person known to have a very high risk and working in a hospital? Wow!
n<149>                    Lets see. The cdc says " don't worry, we are prepared".. So this nurse who helped take care of ebola #1 in the US takes care of other people, where family members come and visit sick families and friends, who go to work and school, some who travel across the country and the World. The cdc now comes out and says " well, we knew this could happen". Really? So did every living person with 1st grade education. 
s<150>                    ANYTHING this administration tells you is a LIE..PROVEN time and time again.  These people are lying to cover up the fact Ebola is going to spread after the most STUPIDEST president ever elected by a dum'd down electorate plays golf and fund raises.
n<151>                    At least she didn't test positive for dope.
n<152>                    Everyone should understand what just happened.  CDC knew about the worker at least since Friday, but waited until Sunday at 3AM in an attempt to bury the news.  In fact, they could  have known about this case well before Friday.  The Liberian Ebola patient in Texas (Duncan) first sought treatment on September 25th, and the normal incubation period is 8 - 10 days, meaning they normally would have known about the worker between October 3 - 5th.  Instead, it's been 17 days since Duncan's first contact with the hospital, which means the incubation period would have been 17 days, which is very very uncommon.  21 days is the THEORETICAL outer limit, which is why it's the quarantine period.
s<153>                    Do not trust the CDC !   And do not trust the World Health Organization or the U.N.  They have an evil agenda for the rest of us up their sleeves.
n<154>                    It has mutated and is now airborne. That seems to be the only explanation for people wearing protection still being able to contract this disease.
n<155>                    This is scary but there are too many people in the world anyway.
s<156>                    Not to worry folks.  The Obama Administration has Ebola totally under control.  No way it can spread in the United States.  In fact, that POS occupying the White House is so confident about that, he's sent thousands of OUR troops to the stricken areas in Africa to build shelters, etc for Ebola victims.  Not a word as to why in the hell THEIR troops can't do it...
s<157>                    I wonder how many more were exposed from this worker.  Don't worry folks, President Eblola has this under control.
n<158>                    The healthcare workers are risking their lives to save others, and many people can only quake in fear over the idea that someone near them might become infected. How obnoxious!
n<159>                    A trained health care worker wearing full protective gear gets Ebola. But they say Ebola isn't highly contagious. I'm a little bit worried that someone isn't telling the whole truth here.
s<160>                    Since the news never reports this anymore; I wonder how many of our soldiers died today while protecting your rights to be free?
s<161>                    So the 'hazmat' suit does nothing. I hate to say this, but I am no longer going anywhere I do not have to, AND am avoiding anyone who looks ill like the plague.
n<162>                    The bad news?  Ebola is more contagious than we had hoped.  The good news?  Maybe this will be a wakeup call for brain-dead liberals.
s<163>                    Google 'U.S. lacks a single standard for Ebola response' it explains a lot
n<164>                    Time to take extreme measures to insure the safety and health of our citizens.  Acting strongly now is an offensive act, do so before we need to bring in the defense.
s<165>                    Yep.  Rather than isolating the disease in a home country, you spread it around, then isolate it.  What kind of absolute morons are in charge here?  Oh.  Liberals.  Always stupid.  Always getting Americans killed.
n<166>                    "This is obviously bad news, it is not news that should bring about panic," Jenkins said. Yes, keep calm, carry on, wait for Ebola to come to you.
n<167>                    Dr. Frieden is practicing the first rule of politics, when in deep shlit, blame the victim.
n<168>                    For a little perspective consider this. The country of Nigeria was infected with 'Obola' when just one man, Patrick Sawyer, from Liberia (a Liberian-American), ignored advice to stay inside his home, after being exposed by his sister who had died. At the time his co-workers were anxious about being around him so they sent him home and told him to stay there, but he decided to go to a conference for his work in Nigeria. By the time his flight arrived from Liberia, in Nigeria, he was violently ill, July 20, dying 5 days later!
n<169>                    ...THIS is proof positive that Ebola can and WILL spread, regardless what the so-called medical officials, etc. say...We're dealing with something that is TOTALLY out of the realm...We're on our on and THAT'S all there is to it...GOOD LUCK...
n<170>                    In an article entitled "Records chronicle Duncan's decline" it states:   Finally, at 2 p.m. on Sept. 30, doctors received the confirmation that all had been dreading: "Patient has tested positive for Ebola ..." The staff attending to Duncan traded their gowns and scrubs for hazmat suits and attendants would scrub the room with bleach.
s<171>                    The Chinese have been building roads (GRATIS, NO LESS) in Central Africa since the late 90s.  I wonder why?  Why has the Ebola outbreak occurred now, when it was  halted several years ago?.  What if this is not a natural reoccurence? It makes person wonder.  How is it we haven't heard of ANY cases in China, home of the world's largest population?  Australia has a case, Europe does and, of course AMERICA DOES!  Ask yourself, WHO has the most to gain from a potential pandemic. Who remains the most isolated, buffered from the rest of the world?  It's not too far a stretch.  Like I said, it makes one wonder  There's a lot of mouths to feed over there....and dwindling resources.
n<172>                    Too little, too late.  CDC dragged its heals when it had the chance to stopped this disease in Liberia in July.  Now the CDC and WHO are talking privately of a global "epidemic" and "exponential growth".
s<173>                    I thought the zombies will bring us into the apocalypse, well I guess this will be close enough.
s<174>                    Why is the US always a country that waits until it happens,to react?Happened all the way back in Pearl Harbor,caught totally off gaurd there,9-11 was another instance,just react when  it happens,then over react and make the country a worse place,and now with ebola,we are reacting 3 months,or even years too late.
n<175>                    The CDC has been saying that it's actually difficult to get this disease, but this nurse was wearing protective clothing and still contracted the disease. So either her luck really sucks.....or the CDC has no ideal what the hell they are talking about..
n<176>                    only way to stop this is to stop the epidemic in west africa, and the only way to do that is providing proper health care and humanitarian aid and rushing the production of the vaccine. If you keep thinking that the best strategy is to hide your head in the ground, ebola will bite you in the butt in no time.
s<177>                    I just got here. Have the liberals blamed President Bush yet?
s<178>                    If there is a silver lining in all this it is going to be reduction of illegals crossing the southern border.  Even they are smart enough to stay away with Ebola in the U.S. and especially with it being in Texas.  Of course, once it breaks out in Mexico or Central or South America they will be crossing the border shoulder to shoulder 100 deep to get to our healthcare system.  Of course that will give Obama the excuse (in his mind) to throw the borders WIDE OPEN for humanitarian reasons.
s<179>                    What are they going to do, prohibit travel?, shut down DFW and IAH for safety reasons.  Just tell the citizens the truth and STOP lying -by telling "we as citizens" have nothing to worry about, UNTIL IT'S TOO LATE.  HONESTY is the GOVT worst enemy!!
s<180>                    Obama and the Democrats are hoping that this will all blowover and you won't remember that in 2010 they were the ones who removed the CDC outlines that would have shutdown the borders and stopped any travel to and from Africa that were put in place by George W. Bush in 2005.
s<181>                    Just for comparison purposes, over 30,000 people in the US die each year from the flu.  If you look at just the past 10 seasons, the average per year is 32,743.
s<19>                                    Donald, thank you for pointing out what should have been obvious to the original poster.
