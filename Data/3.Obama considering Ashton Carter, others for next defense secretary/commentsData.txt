n<1>                    Great listing of a bunch of pencil pushers.  Sounds like no one with actual combat duty behind them is even being looked at.
n<2>                    Anyone with actual military experience? Also lack of influence over the decision making process means Hagel was sidelined.
s<3>                    Qualifications.
n<4>                    He'll probably pick a guy who knows literally nothing about actual combat, defense, or strategic planning.  Someone like himself.
s*<1>                        In this country we have civilian control of the military. That is a good thing.
s*<2>                        To oakland - see how well the "Ebola tzar" is working!
n<5>                    Carter's not black. Doubt he'll be nominated.
s*<1>                        No racial profiling allowed.
n<6>                    I would have expected him to nominate yes sir Arafat. Oh wait a second he's dead
s*<1>                        He may be dead because he can still vote in Chicago.
n*<2>                        Jessie Jackson Jr would be selected,  but he is in jail at this time.
s<7>                    Looks like the post that nobody wants, I wonder why?
s<8>                    Penis nose Obama needs a new stooge to scam the tax money from Americans. Just like he and Hagel did last year when they told Americans they had lost 8.5 trillion tax dollars from the Pentagon. And the people who's privacy and constatution  was replaced with the patriot act could do nothing because they are under a dictatorship. In a blink of a eye 8.5 trillion gone and America sits with their thumb up theirass doing nothing to see it was recovered . Wow that was at that time half our U.S. Debt. Stupid voters who have accomplished nothing with their meaningless votes.
s*<1>                        I am no fan of Obama but the penis nose 
s*<2>                        Bill - the proper name is Dikkhead!
s*<3>                        Bill - the proper name is Dikkhead!
s*<4>                        Indeed, pinus nose is rude because his nose looks more Kardashanian's butt.
n<9>                    Why would Barack Obama nominate a Secretary of Defense, when he has no intention of defending the United States of America?
s*<1>                        really toto? yer just a right-wing hack and a troll to boot! go eat some puppy s#$% !
s*<2>                        When did 9/11 happen again?  Oh yeah G Bush who did it
s<10>                    Whoever it is, he MUST agree with Obama's decisions because Obama continuously ignores all his experts and military advisors.  He must ALSO sign off on Obama's release of the rest of Gitmo's worst terrorists and be ready to take the blame for what goes wrong with that decision.
n<11>                    It is to bad Flournoy bowed out.  She was highly respected by both Gates and Panetta as a thinker and decision maker  She left her post soon after Panetta.  It is very rare for anyone with experience and accolades to directly turn down a Presidential posting.  That is worrisome
n*<1>                        She probably didn't want to be associated with this FUBAR.
n<12>                    Carter is the best we can expect from this President after Flournoy withdrew.  Might as well hire an administrator; policy will be micromanaged by the White House as usual.
n<13>                    This is like watching Al Davis choosing the next head coach.  Nobody with winning credentials will ever apply.   The big questions is, can America make it two more years under this regime?
n<14>                    Buy a mannequin. You can control it, micro manage it, it won't tell the press that you're inept, it won't write a book telling the world that you're inept, it won't embarrass you (well...I hope not anyways) and you don't have to pay it. It will just sit there as the world revolves around you and say nothing.
n*<1>                        And Obungler can drive in the car pool lane with it
s<15>                    First thing you learn with dealing with democrat's its all about them and not what is best for 
s<16>                    How about a US Marine with combat experience?  This would nice for a change instead of some bureaucrat.
s<17>                    He is related to President Carter.
n<18>                    Get a real American with military service, not some politico mo' tweedy foggy bottom loser load Dem sack o skit.
n<19>                    Maybe he'll appoint another racist like Eric Holder.
n<20>                    Come on, just give Valerie Jarrett the job already.  We know she runs the entire operation and pulls all the strings.
n*<1>                        Why would she want to be demoted?
n*<2>                        Why not Martha Fudge?
n<21>                    Hey! I know! Colin Powell! Nah, he's not down with Obama's liberal policies. Maybe Jeh's da man. At least he's black and compliant. By definition, this is a dead-end job under the present regime. Too bad it is so important, bad news for all of us.
n<22>                    Obumbles is looking for another yes man that doesn't look like a total suck up.
s<23>                    A leader would have had someone already to go and accept.
n<24>                    How about a team member from Seal Team Six for Secretary of Defense... someone with a set of teabags that will kick the chit out of the enemy..
n<25>                    I heard it was going to be Louis Farrakhan. I was barricading my house.
s<26>                    Another political hack moves up notch.
n<27>                    Barry's a typical affirmative action hire and has deluded himself into thinking he can do the job. Really all he was supposed to do was keep the seat warm and absolve liberal useful idiots of their white guilt.
n<28>                    Par for Darth Vader - Nominate a Military Hater to Cut their Budget and Leave us Defenseless!!! 
n<29>                    I agreeve, Steve. That would be most expedient. I think it's worse to have unfilled critical positions. And we STILL DO NOT HAVE A SURGEON GENERAL!.
n<30>                    So will John Kerry be the only Secretary of State still standing? Or will his ugly mug be put to rest as well.
n<31>                    Obama is running out of communists to choose from. Maybe Bill Ayres is interested?
n<32>                    Michelle Flournoy is very smart. She probably was the most qualified but  did not want to tarnish her image by answering  to the whims of the President. 
s<33>                    Sounds like a lot of hacks to me.  Obama wants to surrender so badly, but he can't find someone to surrender to.
n<34>                    Obama considering Ashton Carter, others for next defense secretary.You mean he actually found a couple of suckers willing to take the job. I hope they get paid very well.
s<35>                    Experience, fidelity, intelligence. These do not matter. Only unfailing devotion to King Dingle
n<36>                    I'm surprised that Obama's number one pick isn't a black activist riot starter former Acorn academic never-produced anything of substance sort of person.
n<37>                    Might as well nominate Aston Kutcher as this clown.  No one else wants the job.
s<38>                    Is that the grandson of Jimmy Carter who recently lost an election?
s<39>                    Hagel did not resign, He was fired. Resigning is just another word for what the democrats do to their appointees. Resigning and indicting are the democrats go to cards. Or protesting, looting, vandalizing, arson, etc....they call it democracy. but in reality its socialism. See how all of a sudden the whites have joined in? That's their chance to spread their propaganda.  And it worked. For you liberals who have money in the stock market, you just got your assses wiped out after Black Friday didn't meet expectations because of all the violent protesting.
n<40>                    My vote goes to George Patton or Schwarzkopf, both would bring fear to the table. However neither are available.
n<41>                    Obama considering Ashton Carter, others for next defense secretary
s<42>                    To: Reuters
s<43>                    Perhaps if they would tell us what it is in America we have to defend , we might want a Secretary of Defense.  Oh , I know we have oodles and oodles every place else in the World where we can send our Best and Brightest to be killed  , but I'm wondering since the end of the War between the States if we've had to defend anything here.  Except of course from the #$%$ Subs off our shores during WWll.  And of course defending against Watts, New Orleans and Ferguson.  And that's been going on since the Emancipation Proclamation was passed
s<44>                    Difficulty is that the military hates Obama. They know he hates all military. Obama hates America. Most military have a passion in favor of America. Obama and the military are like oil and water.
s<45>                    Oh crap, monkee boy gets to destroy another American position that used to mean something.
n<46>                    5 Secretary of Defenses in six years. Seems there is a bit of a problem.
s*<1>                        Well, it's 3, not 5, and it's less than six years. Both ways it says Obama doesn't give a damn about the nation's defense. All of us smart people have known that since 2007.
s*<2>                        This will be the number five James. And you are right on the money.
n<47>                    None of the first tier candidates with military experience are going to accept that position under Obama.  He's going to have to settle for some inexperienced mutt for the position that will say yes to everything and not tell him he's wrong.  Like Susan Rice for national security adviser or Janet Napolitano for Sec. of Homeland Security.
s<48>                    Nobody wants to work for the Liar-in-Chief. Thank you to all you democrats fr giving us the WORSE president in history! You must be so proud.
s<49>                    We've got nothing but lawyers and school teachers running the government.  If that weren't bad enough in itself, they are all Marxists to boot.
s*<1>                        They could all be considered as IDIOTS! You've heard the statement " The blind leading the blind"! That's what you've got!
s<50>                    Obama called me but I'm not his Huckleberry.
s*<1>                        This like Nixon trying to find an new Attorney General in the middle of Watergate!.
s<51>                    Obama is a buffoon who has absolutely NO CLUE on how to be the commander-in-chief, let alone know 'who' else would be.  Jeh Johnson's name came up, and this stooge couldn't even protect our southern border with that 3rd world DUMP Mexico, so how on earth could we expect him to defend our country?
s<52>                    Ashton Carter?
s<53>                    Obama is the kind of guy who would grab someone else's kid to use as a shield during an emergency.
s<54>                    The #1 qualification for appointment to Obama's cabinet is a high degree of sycophancy.
s<55>                    I have a feeling that the Sultan of Capital Hill gets up every morning in a daze and confused  trying to figure out where those da--xx--mn footsteps of his father is leading him.
s<56>                    What is thy bidding, Emperor Obama?
s<57>                    They candidates march in, the candidates march out, the candidates march in circles wondering what it is all about. Who will be next on the alter of hate, Obama looking for another fool, and just can't wait!
s<58>                    Why not Mickey Mouse?  Obama Admin's micromanagement makes the position obsolete.
n<59>                    I don't think Ashton Carter is the right person for the job. As a former Pentagon's chief arms buyer, I'm thinking that he'll be working for the military/industrial complex buying arms for them instead of what the military need.
n<60>                    Joe Lieberman would make a good choice, but Obama needs a yes man!
s<61>                    Give the Secretary of Defense job to Monica Lewinsky.  She will have all the men standing at attention and she has already proven she can take a shot to the chest.
s<62>                    Go ahead and turn Defense over to China Obama!You know you hate America so go ahead.The liberals elected you and they want to destroy our country so do it.
s<63>                    Next week Obama will be looking for walk-ons and Disney will later make a movie about it.
s<64>                    Next he'll be considering Homer Simpson.
s<65>                    THE IDIOT!! HAS NO CLUE WHAT TO CONSIDER; NEVER HAS!!!
n<66>                    We've got a Muslim running the CIA, a New Black Pamper running the White House, why not have Iranian born Big Val Jarrett run the DOD? It would be perfectly in profile for this Obama Admenstruation.
s<67>                    Thanks to the policies of the Obama/Hillary/Kerry triumvirate, the US is a laughingstock in the world and feared and respected by no one.  Can't see why anyone would want to step into that situation.
s<68>                    Obama should think outside the box.  
n<69>                    The guy's first name is Ashton. It's neither a male nor a female name. It could go both ways. That screams INDECISIVE to me.
s<70>                    As usual Obama pick a real 'winner'  WRONG!  Another looser for Obama!
s<71>                    Lawyers - Homeland security - #$%$. sec of what or why it  all sounds like a bureaucratic cluster pluck! And we are the ones holding the bag, after all our top br#$%$ with all it's battle experience is eased out of control of our military. Can you hear the fan humming, and the bag of #$%$ getting ready to be tossed into it?
n<72>                    No way -- A WHITE GUY?? I do not see that happening.  He is going to pick the most incompetent person he can find. Then everything is going to become a racial thing when the new Senate is sworn in. The next 2 years are going to get ugly. The nation will be more divided then it was during the civil war.
s<73>                    It is pity to see that the only one thing left that we can do – wars, the Pentagon, and all the business associated with it, is about to get the “Obama-care” touch ("... and at his lack of influence over the decision-making process ...").
s<74>                    Another appointment to the Jester's Court by our King ? When will the Jouster's (come out)
s<75>                    Do what you want Barack. After birth certificate conspiracies, Benghazi investigations, government shutdowns and 6 freaking years of waiting for the Obamapocalypse to destroy Whiteys Murika, (any day now I suppose), the Ammosexuals, WalMart CracKKKers and trailer-park raised inbred teabaggers got diddly-squat coming. F-em...they would investigate if you declared, "Water is wet". God bless freedumb.
s<76>                    Nobody worth their salt wants anything to do with the Grand Buffoon.
s<77>                    Obama Internal Memo:  "We need to find a Fall Guy, some moron who can take all of the hits for our massive fraud, corruption and incompetence.  Can be a con man, a #$%$, a circus clown. Go all out.... Somebody find out what Holder's plans are after the New Year..."
s<78>                    I say Oppose anyone Obama nominates.  His past record speaks for itself.
s<79>                    WOW! A year and a half job of nothingness. As long as the lying POS owebuma is still in office, the military will be in disarray.
s<80>                    I wonder if Al (not so)Sharpton has interviewed for the job yet - just the threat of sending him to negotiate ought to be enough to bring our enemies to their knees - with the same laughter they share when telling Obama jokes.
s<81>                    With the total obstructionist stance of the Republicans, President Obama could nominate Jesus Christ to any position and the Republicans would fight him tooth and nail.
n<82>                    Another academic wonk from the Clinton Administration.  As such, he is UNQUALIFIED to be Secretary of Defense.  America has too many academics in this Administration - needs to be a REAL world individual.  Unfortunately, in this Administration, they are not allowed.  A Democrat Secretary of Defense is an oxymoron.
s<83>                    I would be concerned about anyone who would be willing to work for this micromanaging narcissist.
n<84>                    Why is everyone wondering about who Obama will pick?  He will not be making the choice.  Valerie Jarrett will be making the choice, as she does will all the others Obama is suppose to be making.  Obama cannot even choose which golf club to use.
n<85>                    Hope he nominates a person who is not a lapdog.  With the turnover there it seems, thankfully, he hasn't yet.
n<86>                    He was really good in 'Dude, Where's My Car', but his work since Demi just seems lackluster.  I wouldn't give him Defense, maybe Commerce?
s<87>                    For every candidate there's only one question to ask... how much Chap Stick do you think you will need for how much you will kiss Obama's @#$% in this job?
n<88>                    THIS GUY CARTER MUST BE A SYCOPHANTIC BUTT KISSING PUPPET AND  A DEFINITE YES SIR BOSSMAN BOOT LICKER IF HE TAKES THIS CABINET POSITION.
s*<1>                        Don't forget butt-boy for the LezDoms in the White House.
s<89>                    It's gonna be tough to find someone who will, unquestioningly, do everything Obama tells him/her to do.....even while knowing that what they are ordered to is NOT in the best interest of
s<90>                    Obama is a Muslim Brotherhood lover. He's still crying over Egypt. It would be hard, as an American patriot, to work with him but someone has to. Our kids are at war and they need someone who has their backs speaking up when necessary.
n<91>                    I've got an idea...how about Ashton Kutcher for our next Secretary of Defense? That way, we would have incompetent jokers in the positions of President, Vice President and Secretary of Defense. What the heck? Why not give the rest of the world something else to laugh about? I say, round out the comedy team.
s*<1>                        @Dennyboy ... wow, this story brought out the worst of the right-wing hacks for their daily parade!
s*<2>                        Wow, Frankie, coming from the likes of you I will consider that a complement.
n<92>                    Let's make sure that we pick someone with no significant field operations command experience...that way he can be or play dumb with all the mistakes he'll make.
s<93>                    Obama is barely qualified to be a buy here pay here car salesman.
s<94>                    A list of potential future Barrack Hussein BS artist puppets.
s*<1>                        you must be a piece of work Danny; lets see your serious side, half-wit!
s<95>                    It would be amazing if Obama nominated someone competent, which would be a first for Obama.
s<96>                    It doesn't matter who Obama picks.  That person will be a puppet whose strings are pulled by Obama's left-wing fringe political team.
s*<1>                        And, that would differ from other presidents how??????????????? By the way, left wing fringe do not, as a rule, support military adventurism, so you need to review the FOX news facts as, even they, know that.
s*<2>                        Remember that it is primarily politics which govern Obama's decisions.  They are not commited to doing what is necessary to defeat the terrorists.  They only are doing the minimum to avoid political repercussions for Democrats.
s*<3>                        Defeat the terrorists. Military industrial complex likes that mentality. You got duped
s*<4>                        I suppose you think you are immune to terrosist action?
s*<5>                        Larry, turn off the tv, hate radio and fake news sites and it is amazing how rare actual terrorism is. But, that doesn't make money so keep worrying and fearing....like Jay said, you been duped but its jobs, jobs, jobs...right?
s<97>                    The GOP will block anyone who Obama nominates.
s*<1>                        good idea.
s<98>                    Almost all of Obama's Czars are Communist Muslims. Where does this guy stand???
s*<1>                        Look it up. That is a FACT!!!
s*<2>                        Just looked it up.  It says you're wrong.  Look it up, it's a fact.
n<99>                    Talk about scraping the bottom of the barrel. I've got at least 5 people in my neighborhood more qualified. Qualifications however are not a requisite. Obedience to the master is the only requisite. But with everyone else turning down the job, what can you expect?
n*<1>                        I am far from an Obama fan, but unless you live in a neighborhood full of retired generals and defense contractor executives, I find it very hard to believe you have 5 people in your neighborhood more qualified than the current Deputy Defense Secretary.  I would say that obedience to the master is the primary requisite.
n*<2>                        At least he's experienced with resigning from the Defense Department.
n*<3>                        I find it very hard to believe you have 5 people in your neighborhood more qualified than the Formal Deputy Defense Secretary
s<100>                    Is he a Communist Muslim like Obama also?
s*<1>                        You just like guys
s*<2>                        @todd, ??? Are you an idiot???
s*<3>                        Yahoo is full of idiots
s*<4>                        Yes, ACS, Yahoo is full of idiots.  You are the quintessential example of that exact statement.
s*<5>                        Colleges are full of idiots, too, just saying.
s*<6>                        ACS, agreed. Only an uneducated Faux minion believes one can be both a communist and a Muslim....LMAO!!!
s*<7>                        Oh look, it's useless Carl.  Did Fidelity let you leave early today?  Did you lose a lot of money for the investors today?
s*<8>                        Communist Muslim?  Bit of a contradiction there.
s<101>                    It really doesn't matter who is appointed by this president. Whoever it is will bring outrage and complaint from the GOP. Jesus Christ could be nominated and we would still here what an awful choice the president is making. It has nothing to do with the work of "we the people" and everything to do about the politics.
s*<1>                        tampon or hanky?
s*<2>                        Makes no difference to me. Either one could be stuffed up your backside and it wouldn't matter to me one way or the other. I guess it's whatever you prefer.
s<102>                    Is J Fred Muggs available, He would jump thru Hoops for the President and work for a few bananas.. Indeed a top contender near the top of the tree.
n<103>                    "....and replace the resigning Chuck Hagel, administration sources said on Monday."
n<104>                    Whoever accepts this nomination/job is the perfect example of someone who would take a bet on 'tails you lose, heads I win'.
n<105>                    I have a great idea, get some one with military experience
s*<1>                        Hey D/A the military will never run the military .Let the criminals run the prison ?...idiot
s*<2>                        I think it takes a wee bit more than just military experience...
s*<3>                        It took nothing to be President. A little experience would be a nice change.
n<106>                    Obama is not looking for someone qualified and bright enough to be our Secretary of Defense.  He is just looking for another "Yes Man".
n<107>                    Bowe Bergdahl is available Barry.  He should fit in nicely with your clown crew.
s<108>                    YOU built it obama, you run it.
s<109>                    Obama should just stop kidding everybody and put his buddy Al Sharpton in charge like he wants to. Damned racists.
n<110>                    call me crazy but why would you not have retired military as defense sect.? but then why would you have a lawyer in charge of homeland security? who da thunk it?
s*<1>                        Because none of the retired generals are dumb enough to take the job.
s<111>                    The back bench is still quite deep.
n<112>                    Hagel made public statements about just how dangerous ISIS is and hinted that Obama's plan was ineffective AND THAT does not set well with our all-knowing almighty leader...he's gone!
s<113>                    Maybe you could give the job to one of Fergusons Gentle Giants?
n<114>                    We might as well have Ashton Kutcher head the DOD. He'd probably do a better job than any of your political lowlife picks.
s<115>                    Not hispanic, lesbian, black, etc... Interesting....
s<116>                    I suggest Susan Rice-she knows how to get on her knees
s*<1>                        And catch every drop.
s<117>                    "What difference does it make?" Everyone knows the new SECDEF will only be a figurehead under Obama and Jarrett.
s<118>                    Ashton who ?
n<119>                    Whoever is selected as the Defense Secretary must face a far more severe test than ISIS and Ukraine.It is the national security advisor Susan Rice,who has her own script for all possible security threats to the U.S.
s<120>                    He must be able to pucker up and kiss donkey real well.
s<121>                    Hey, if you can order equipment SURELY you can construct a winning military strategy using the stuff you ordered . . .right? Guess they can stick pencils in the terrorist's eyes?
s<122>                    Barry thought he was Ashton Kutcher... Obama loved Dude Where's my Car!
s<123>                    Obama found another yes man that will do as he is told and shut his mouth
n<124>                    I am shocked it is not Ashton Kutcher.
n<125>                    Why not just give it to is largest donor?  It's not like competency matters.  Look who's running the show.
s<126>                    OBAMA IS A CRIMINAL . . . .IMPEACH HIS TRAITOROUS KENYAN LYING BUT.
s<127>                    I swear, I thought at first it was Ashton Kutcher.
s<128>                    If you don`t mind getting thrown under the bus and being the scapegoat  for a fool go ahead and take the job you deserve it.
n<129>                    Oh god...not Jeh Johnson.  He would be a colossal failure...much like he is in his current position.
s<130>                    High profile candidates? You call these jokers high profile? The line from SNL is appropriate here "Lower expectations"
s<131>                    The important question to the SecDef nominee is, when will Obama surrender to ISIS?
s<132>                    I want GI JOE or Clint Eastwood they would stand up to OBOZO!
s*<1>                        You can't disagree with the Emperor and stay in that job.
s<133>                    what qualified military strategist would want the thankless job of explaining proper military response to a meathead?
s<134>                    "No strategy" needs a creative defender....
s<135>                    An announcement is expected in coming days, 
s<136>                    Advice for Mr Carter if he's considering the job:
s*<1>                        Wouldn't he be saying "Yes Massah?"
s*<2>                        I stand corrected....!!!
s<137>                    Good Luck!  I think he will be reporting to Michelle--right?
s<138>                    who in their right mind would want this dead end job?
s<139>                    I am the Anointed One.  The Smartest person ever born.  I hate the USA.  My name is Barry, I mean Barrack.
s<140>                    Sign up Ray Rice.
n<141>                    Carter is not Black so he is at best a stand-by choice.
s<142>                    Why not a another black guy?
n<143>                    Jeh Johnson is seriously a candidate? 
n<144>                    Jew Ashton Baldwin Carter deliberately undermined of the reputation of Chuck Hagel, a cost of 13 American lives for one day. Not hard to guess what will happen when unite a Jew-Minister of Defense with the Jews which usurped the US manufacturing resources.
s<145>                    Wow those are some real heavy hitters?
s<146>                    I thought Obama was going to put a Lesbian in there
s<147>                    Looks like he would make a good Gymnastics coach, Deacon or Chiropractor, then again Barry looks like a Custodian and Moochelle a Australopethicus
s<148>                    CFR member:  Check
s<149>                    Bur he is white must be gay
s*<1>                        intelligent post scuz-bag!
