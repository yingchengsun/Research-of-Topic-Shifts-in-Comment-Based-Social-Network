s<1>                    I wonder what would happen if all police officers would walk off the job for one week?  After the stores were empty, everything was burned down, and havoc covered the US, maybe some of these idiots would wake up.  I haven't had all happy experiences with the police, but my idea of trouble is being followed right after I was doing 50 in a 35.  Ive never been in danger of being shot, or beat up...but of course Ive never robbed or assaulted anyone , or done drugs, ever been arrested, or been in jail, but Im an old guy.  Nowadays it seems every other person has been in jail for something.  I think these guys are needed.
s*<1>                        Fred, someone like yourself makes too much sense for these ignorant people to understand.  But I must admit that it would be fun to sit back and watch what would happen if officers were able to go on strike in these people's neighborhoods only.
s*<2>                        Same thing will happen when they are on duty.  Crime will happen.  Just no janitors to clean up.
s*<3>                        That would be awesome. I could finally open my Cadillac ATS Premium sports sedan and see what that baby can really do.
s*<4>                        Society functions not because we have police officers but because most people act in a decent honest manner.
n<2>                    All this does is to make the police officer an easier target. The Criminals have the weapons they obtain from the military black market, Uzis and AK's and M16's. what are the police suppose to do, turn their back when they see a black doing something wrong, Just because he is black. I am getting the feeling that it might be better for the black community to police itself. They don't want to follow any rules of conduct or community talks unless they are about what "they" want, not about how the people should follow the police commands or conduct themselves in a manner as not to invite the police to act as police. But What do I know, I went through the race riots, the black panthers farce and the I am black and better then you attitude, for the last 30-40 years, It an't got no better. I will say this though, the hate for toward whites from blacks of the lower class has gotten worst. There is an almost palatable feeling of anger when going in an area of many blacks or mostly black community This feeling is starting to move out to the urban areas of cities. Has any one else felt it or am I just feeling something that isn't really there?
n<3>                    Fail to follow orders issued by a police officer and your chances of becoming hurt or dead increase by orders of magnitude, regardless of your skin color. Michael Brown would be alive if he did as he was told - albeit in a jail cell, but alive. Period. As for the military equipment provided to the Ferguson area law enforcement agencies actually being deployed...well duh... the ''demonstrations'' and rioting ironically proved the need for such equipment in an urban setting. The thinly veiled pandering by leftist politicians is nothing short of astounding...military style equipment made looters and rioters feel bad and intimidated - sooooooo....we should rethink giving law enforcement the tools they manifestly need to quell mob violence. The infantile or at least adolescent thinking and policy making of the left would be laughable, if it were not so completely predictable that the boomerang is going to come back and hit the rest of us squarely  in the head. Here is a news flash for those offended by a "militarized" police force - don't loot and riot, don't celebrate thuggery, don't swallow the fetid pabulum served up by the likes of Al Sharpton , or respond to that type of race-baiting with violence / intimidation and the military style equipment you find so offensive will gather a heavy layer of dust from lack of use..... a layer of dust thoroughly welcomed by the  law enforcement personnel equipped to use it.
n<4>                    The camera's are a good idea both in the car and on the officers, if Wilson would have had one on there would have been video proof of the incident, on the other side of things what are we supposed to do go back to the days when the all the police had were shotguns and pistols and were totally out gunned by criminals who had AK's (Hollywood shootout comes to mind) and other military gear?
n*<1>                        There would have done the same thing.  They would say the camera was rigged.  These people do not understand truth, ony what they want.  Obama change includes making the Blackman more rebelias not smarter.
s<5>                    Yes ... the illegal mus*lime continuing to blame the cops and everybody but the dam perpetrators themselves.  If the jungle bunnies could be taught and made to obey even the basics of the laws most of the problem would be solved.  How in hell long is congress going to let this IDIOT keep screwing up everything he touches.  Had he kept his F ing nose out of this and the Martin case half these problems would not be happening.  Two GD thugs getting away with acting like complete animals.  Cops should just say to hell with it ... do what they can to stop but if they are threatened just walk away and let the animals eat each other.  What he should have done is told Jackson, Sharpton, Holder to mind their own F ing business as keep the he!! out of there totally.
n<6>                    Body cameras on law enforcement officials sound great. But let's also make sure that all the convicted criminals are required to wear them as well, both in jail and when they are released. While you are at it, perhaps politicians should be wearing them as well, after-all, the voters have the right to see and hear what is being said behind those closed doors. (Fair is fair, so make sure you level the playing field, before you start playing this intrusive game.)
n<7>                    I'm all for police officers to wear video devices... but $75 million for UP TO 50,000 cameras is ridiculous to say the least. I can equip exactly 50,000 officers with rugged mini 1080p hd cameras for $10 million. Government is paying $1500 per camera! Will the officers be wearing Canon DSLR cameras? I think not. The camera pictured above is no more than $100. Many officers today wear a wide angle HD camera called a Mobius which costs $68. If I buying 50000 units, I'm paying $50 each. Can I get a vote to run our country's finances... I'll get Autobahn quality roads too
s<8>                    Where were the Civil Rights Advocates????
s*<1>                        Great post.
s*<2>                        Those deaths will not advance the race card agenda
s*<3>                        This is why white people should arm themselves.  Do not become a statistic to these animals.  Remember, death is forever!
s*<4>                        White deaths by Black perpetrators never matter or are reported because it is inflammatory! LOL! That is the joke and White idiots believe it too! Black people are killers and hate White people. They want to rob them of their very lives and jobs just because the can. They do not want their jobs because they are losers on welfare but the hate is what they think makes them matter!
s*<5>                        Channon and Hugh couldn't be victims of hate crimes because of their skin color....
s*<6>                        Any malicious assault resulting in disability or death by a party of differing race, should be classified as a HATE CRIME. 
s*<7>                        Victims should have equal rights to perpetrators.
s*<8>                        Yes, the perps were charged and sentenced....to death even.  The issue people are upset about isn't the "crime" itself...I mean we've had plenty of horrible crimes.  Look at Jeffrey Dahmer.  It doesn't get much worse than luring people to your home, just to eat them for dinner/a midnight snack.  The issue is that when certain people do certain things they are NOT charged, they get off free.  These boys were sentenced to death...GOOD.  The legal system "worked."  People are saying it doesn't "work" for them... no one will get charged, they will go free with no reprimand what so ever.  Again, it's not the crime... it's how an incident is HANDLED.  This is a horrible crime.  I'm glad they caught the perps and they have been charged and sentenced.... that is LEGAL justice.  Some feel they will never get the same benefits of "justice."  THAT is what this is about.
s*<9>                        Killing michael brown was not getting away with something, It was doing his job!
s*<10>                        @Edward
s*<11>                        Dahmer didn't sexually torture and molest his victims.
s*<12>                        Evidently, Civil Rights Laws were written for BLACKS.   I have NEVER in my life been prejudice, but this #$%$ with Ferguson and OUR President and administration is turning my stomach......
s*<13>                        not my kids they were ANGELS they would never do nothing like this
s*<14>                        Yup, I remember reading about that. Around the same time the little white baby was shot in the face in Atlanta because the mother didn't have any money for them to steal.
s*<15>                        I read about this some time ago. This was a HATE crime but Holder does nothing. These people were brutalized because they were white. Period. Under Obama and Holder hate crimes are only white on black, don't you know.
s*<16>                        There were no  outcry that I remember but werent those two white.Whites dont randomly loot and burn their homes and businesses down to spite a law or to say their persons were killed.
s*<17>                        @Nomorelies, the perpetrators in your story were charged and sentenced while the killer cop Wilson walked free! What's your point?
s*<18>                        They were arrested, charged and convicted what protest did you want? Were you there... protesting? Why not? Dumb (s)(h)(i)(t).
s*<19>                        @ Edward - every black person in the U.S. is a perpetrator, or a future perpetrator.
s*<20>                        Remember, you white liberal idiots, it DONT make you a " good " person to love Africans................white liberals 35 years ago made that " the rule " ...........not God.  Blind Obama voting morons.
s*<21>                        What was the motive in this crime I remember reading about the murders but somehow missed the solving  of the crime and trial story.
s*<22>                        Don’t understand why you’re bringing this up? The perps are awaiting their fate in a jail cell aren’t they?  If they walked away without a trial I’m sure everyone and their mother would be out in the streets.  You people crying about looters so are the people that live there. You failed to mention the people of Ferguson also went out to protect these businesses. Where was the outrage white protesters rioted in Seattle? Funny thing about this country is when it happens to poor minorities no one care but as time goes on it happens to whites even worse. I.E. crack business model has morphed into meth.
s*<23>                        hammer - Because he's a stupid racist and doesn't know any better.
s*<24>                        Come on people. They want all whites dead. It's obvious they wanted Officer Wilson to loose that fight.
s*<25>                        Timmy McVeigh slaughters over a hundred and is made a martyr by GOP lemmings
s*<26>                        I guess when the agitators or race baitors say life matters; it's only blacks life.  These animals deserve the worst possible death.  That is evil; pure and simple.  There are no words that I can think of to offer as comfort for these 2 young people.
s<9>                    ( If the truth is no good ) just think how they will twist the vidio record up.( Lawyers will say you can`t believe what you see ) JUST ASK SHARPTON  No news on 15-16 year olds thaking hammers to a white man in Saint Louis and killing him 12-1-14 ( TRUTH  ) where is it CNN ??? Major news stations have no guts, balls, or morals. They made more money with stiring up riots.Shame on all of us allowing a one way road with no rules anymore.

n<10>                    Did the troops in Benghazi get trained on the equipment they had?  Hmmm but this government didn't aid them when the chips were down  ... you know, like they came to the aid of the black protest movement against American Law Enforcement in Ferguson, I forgot.  Did Holder provide private training to the Cartels he sold the guns to for Fast And Furious?  No wait, we can't be sure that happened obama is still keeping that information to himself or something isn't he?  Want our Law Enforcement Officers to have second rate equipment?  I don't.  There is no need for military personnel to train Police, they have sufficient instructors of their own who can easily learn to apply new advancements in weapons, communication, APC's and the like to civilian Law Enforcement.  But ... what's the use of fancy high tech equipment that could be used against terrorists like the ones that burned Ferguson when this administration won't permit it's use anyway?  IMPEACH OBAMA, do whatever you like with Holde
s*<1>                        Did the Marines in Beirut in 1982 know that being sent into a war zone unarmed may be dangerous? Hmmmm........STILL waiting on that set of needed hearings into the criminal act of St Ronnie and friends
s<11>                    hey Obama, maybe you should spend some time with the police during riots to see first hand what they have to deal with and respond do!  they are not provoking these thugs, they are there too respond and ensure public safely, pure and simple.  watch the video of these thugs looting stores costing these business thousands of $!  if the looters were white and the store owners were black, then you would be going after the protesters, but you don't want to #$%$ off the black community I guess.
s*<1>                        Like Shrubbery Sr
s*<2>                        He would be way too scared to do that.  If the rioters knew he was there they would suddenly turn into little puppies till he leaves.
s*<3>                        John, some of the looters were white.  Liberal punks.
n<12>                    One should first ask why does the federal government have all this excess equipment especially Justice and Homeland Security.  These agencies have just as much or less need than locl police departments.  Research as shown that gangs are better armed then the average police force to begin with. Without a show of force how does one combat say a riot - fire bombings - looting? Both Holder and obama encouraged "peaceful protests". Considering both come from the streets one would expect they knew the protests would be anything but "peaceful".  N law abiding citizen should have anything to fear from a well armed police force. There will always be small instances where force if excessive but one should be more concerned that the two centrally controlled agencies (justice-homeland) would over react then the local police department.
s*<1>                        Man, if those protests in Ferguson were peaceful, what happens when their not.
s*<2>                        isn't hypocritical that obama is protected, along with the rest of his family, by the most militarized law enforcement agencies in America, with armored vehicles, high tech equipment, sam missiles on his roof, high powered riffles, riot gear, etc; but denies the average American and law enforcement agencies the same protection?
n<13>                    Ruh Roh! We didn't think about who those military weapons would be used against! We thought those statistics on the prison population were racist propaganda! If the police, whose job it is to protect and enforce our laws are to wear a camera at all times how about barry, whose job it is to protect this country and follow its laws and constitution, wear one also. I'm sure if we had video of every closed door meeting and conference we would find out a lot about "this most un-American" president's real motivation to his systematic destruction of this once greatest country.
s*<1>                        you mean we should have videos allowed in the closed door meetings when Republicans are kissing big business  #$%$ for donations ? It would have been a good Idea to have a video in the Bush white house when he was lying his butt off about Iraq.
s<14>                    I am so sick of Our Republican Senators Hiding from answering the Black Rioters in Ferguson. What the Mayors of Ferguson and St. Louis should do is follow the example
s*<1>                        Don't forget, though, that Mayor Daily may have also been on the mob payroll.  Of course, Obama might have been as well.
n<15>                    obama, who is protected by one of the most militarized law enforcement agencies in the country, protecting not only him but his entire family with SAM missiles on his roof, armored vehicles, the most powerful high tech equipment and  will be protected for the rest of his life, is going to deny OUR law enforcement officers and  American citizens the same protection HE HAS.  Not only are OUR law enforcement officers target of rioters, looters, protesters, and any black person screaming the race card, the government is now warning all military and law enforcement THEY are the targets of isis and obama want to demilitarize them, making it harder to not only defend themselves but innocent Americans  and their property from these rioters gone wild and possible isis threats against fellow Americans.  obama will NEVER have to face these animals, nor will HIS family.   What kind of hypocritical liar is this man.  Are WE not good enough to receive the SAME protection as he and his family?
s*<1>                        Only if your black.
s*<2>                        Rodney King.......1991 trial........Shrubbery Sr. has justice dept charge the officers with civil rights charges.........
s<16>                    This Hole thing could be fixed If the Parents of the black people would have had the respect of there for-fathers to teach there children to do the same .Did not there parents go threw the race riots of the 60's as that what they are teaching .Be- careful for what you black people wish for you mite just get it !! ASK yourself where would you be if not for all the free housing .free food , free phones , free education , free health care , free money every mouth you live like pigs!!! your homes are a #$%$ hole ,you do not keep up your yards ,garbage is pilled up outside your door because your are to lazy to take it out .Your kids ? will not go there is not there fault it is yours !!!
s*<1>                        Just like Shrubbery Sr and Sr Ronnie of the Jellybean and their welfare giveaways

n<17>                    A great deal of the military surplus equipment that is here in Florida are old style, Helos, APC's, Small Arms and a whole bunch of uniforms.
s<18>                    REPOST THIS OVER AND OVER AND OVER
n<19>                    Hey, here's a concept. Don't commit crimes and you won't place yourself in negative situations. (If any of the taxpayer dollars are going to be spent on cameras it should be for those of you with previous arrest records to wear body cameras that stream the footage to law enforcement. If at any time the cameras are removed or tampered with, police will be notified. That way everyone around you will be held accountable as well and last week's verdict would have been made without question). Let me repeat this message: Do not commit crimes.
s<20>                    Executive Order -- National Defense Resources Preparedness signed by Obama. March 2012.
s*<1>                        See 1991 for double jeopardy by Shrubbery Sr
s*<2>                        one world government, spying on us citizens , DHS building fenced compounds topped with razor wire, sounds like hitler to me. its the end of days
s<21>                    I've got news, the equipment wasn't used on anyone that was home and not rioting.  You can protest, march, etc, just don't riot, loot, and burn other peoples property, or you should get tear gassed.  You all need a better role model that a guy strong arm robbing while on drugs, walking down the middle of the road impeding traffic, and getting into fights with police officers.  If this is your role model, no wonder you think your behavior is alright.  Since when do blacks not have to obey laws the same as whites?
s<22>                    Recently, a family in my neighborhood had an early morning visit from our local police department(SWAT, NTF, Gang Investigators).  The family is from the local Indian Reservation(they were kicked off the Reservation).  The dad is a young 20 something, and he was growing marijuana and selling it out of the house.  The mother, same age, knew what he was doing and is okay with it.  They have four very young children that were taken away by CPS.  SWAT had to be called in to lead because they knew there were weapons inside the house.  There were, of course: 2 hunting rifles(unregistered and modified), bullet clips, and loads of ammo.  
n<23>                    It still amuses me seeing how many people think that riot gear and assault weapons are somehow new equipment for the police. The police back in the 1920s had submachine guns (Tommyguns) and automatic rifles (BARs). As for the vehicles, MRAPs are nothing more than very well armored trucks. All of this "tank" nonsense is completely misinformed. There are some police departments with tracked armored personnel carriers, or so I've heard, but no police department in the country has anything approaching a tank (tracks, armor resistant to RPGs and heavy explosives, high-velocity cannons, machine guns, etc).
n<24>                    Training? The question should be why can't the Obama Administration work with anyone in government? Jay Nixon the Governor of Missouri State is a Democrat.  Why does Obama Administration Eric Holder always step on States laws and rights with their bizarre political stances and political rhetoric that ignore facts of the issues?  Both are lawyers .. why do none of them understand the concept of Grand Jury or Probable Cause? There was never a race issue.  Brown was captured on camera and identified as the suspect robbery suspect who assaulted a much smaller store clerk.
n<25>                    "Mundane" police activities.  Ha.  What that means is that it takes only one good punch in the nose before Officer Degree resigns.  Police departments will not bypass a person for being more educated.  That would be ridiculous.  In fact, you must have at least an associates degree to join an accredited police department or most suburban departments.  If you meet the basic qualifications and can pass all of the tests (including the background investigation, which most people can't pass), you may be given a job offer.  It has nothing to do with prior military or more educated candidates.  As a former police officer and administrator, I have found it necessary, on several occasions, to explain to former military personnel that law enforcement and the military are 2 different animals.  I once spoke with an active army ranger who was interested in becoming a police officer.  He said, "I just want to kick down doors and shoot people".  I quickly responded by telling him that we try not to do that.  I certainly hope he stayed in the military.
n<26>                    Sounds good, But his words usually ends up lying. We will see. What worries me is he wanting an all out federal police force that rivals our military, He was recorded talking about this before getting into office in 2007. So as long as he is not trying to disarm local and city police force and then trying to give federal police, HLS power over them, In a county a elected Sheriff holds authority giving to him by his county by the people in his state.
n<27>                    I have always said Law Enforcement should wear cameras. I learned in the academy that one of the agencies close to us issues cameras to be worn on the shoulder. They said that complaints of excessive force has dropped substantially since they were issued. That could be a result of two things but what is important and undisputed is that they have worked. I like the Idea because if an Officer approaches some one and they run we have good pictures of them. Which also has had a good impacted the number of assaults against LEOs has dropped as well. People tend to not run and fight knowing that they are being recorded.
s<28>                    Obama's Vision for America:
s<29>                    Lets get real here. In Ferguson there were over two hundred gunshots fired countless .rocks bricks, baseball bats, glass bottles,hammers Molotov cocktails  and any thing else that could be used to cause bodily harm to persons or properties. 
n<30>                    seems to me that we have a failure by the Obama administration to address the core problem.  If we really want to solve the problem of policing black neighborhoods, then we need police in outreach centers right in the neighborhoods that know the locals, walk beats in the neighborhoods, build trust and friendship, and arrange counseling for troubled kids.  Training cops is useless if we do not address the real problem of criminal mentality and racism instilled into youth in the black community.
n<31>                    "as a significant number of weapons and vehicles previously allocated have gone missing."  Huh?  This is beginning to sound a lot like taxpayer forfeiture laws.  I am extorted by the government under threat of force and incarceration.  The government spends my money to buy #$%$ they don't need and pass it down the line to local cops, who fence it to buy stuff they want.  How is this program any different from welfare, other than most of the money goes into making #$%$ that nobody needs or wants.  Oh right, that is just payment to the military-industrial complex for all those campaign contributions.
n<32>                    There is a country song called "Pi### in the Wind" and it's blowing all over my friends. With out "beloved President" buying 50K cameras comes the question, who get's them? There are more than 50,000 federal agents, many more on the state and local level. So if you order all of the cameras, what happens if you are the one on the totum pole that does not get a camera and something happens? Are you guilty because you did not have a camera? Is this a live feed or recorded? Who pays for all those costs? 
s*<1>                        You would have to be an idiot not to know how to use a go pro and they only cost $250
s*<2>                        Taxpayers will pay for the cameras.  Frankly this shouldn't bother you because it favors all parties involved.
n<33>                    odumer inciting a war between blacks and whites also inciting a riot between policeman and blacks  why don't his body guards have the same executive orders he's dishing out and as far as thug browns should have been parents instead of grandma wanting officers equip with body cameras they would have capture mcspadden and 4 other thugs beating a vendor with a pipe in Oct. 2014 almost all blacks want is to be above the law so they continue to steal burn kill and destroy anything and everyone they wish odumer needs to practice what he dishes out he as racist as the idiots in Mo. he fits right in odumer's a #$%$ poor excuse for any title except racist  Mo. ought to use extreme measurerments against all the rioter that all these people will understand
s<34>                    What's up with this crap that they take time out to do there black Friday. So there going to stop fighting when holydays or a certain day they want to do. WTF is that oh I'm not fighting today cause there's a big sale going on and can't miss it please. Well Christmas is next rest on that day of course. So they have the call idiots! They fight each other. those are the one's there hurting. There making them self's look stupid that's all.
s*<1>                        Are you delusional?  I've never seen a post that made less sense.
n<35>                    WHAT'S FAIR IS FAIR....If the police need to wear the cameras then I think it's only fair that criminals also wear cameras. Obama can achieve this with an Executive Order. I think every elected official should be required to wear a camera while he is on duty serving the public.  This way we can see what our politicians are doing when they are " on duty".  Hey, what's fair is fair. Actually doctors and lawyers, and teaches and business people, fireman and sanitation workers, and taxi drivers, and carpenters and plumbers.... should also wear cameras.  Hey, what's fair is fair. And we should have all our children wear cameras on their way to school, while in school and on the way home from school....just in case they accuse or are accused of some infraction of the rules.  Hey, what's fair is fair.
n<36>                    Systems to log the weapons, and training for cops to use them more efficiently against American civilians is not the issue.  The issue is the desire of cops (and their handlers) to use them at all.  The only solution is to STOP giving these professional thugs any military equipment.  Period.  If the army is needed, cops, call it in - and go back to giving speeding tickets.
n<37>                    That's YOUR hard earned money that is arming your local police departments. Is that how you want your tax dollars spent? For armaments to be used against civilians? Why is there no public accountability of our dollars spent by local police departments? The annual operating budget for every police department in America should be clearly itemized and available for public viewing on the department's webpage. This should include salaries (names not required) and overtime expenditures. Does every small town police department near a body of water need two large fast police boats? Why is every police cruiser a gas guzzling pursuit car or SUV? Couldn't half of those cars be fuel efficient and use the saved money to hire more officers? Or buy equipment to keep them safer? Or decrease our taxes?
s<38>                    First off this racists president can't fund anything, this is the job of the C.B.O. to allocate funds. He unlawfully bypassed the C.B.O once with his stimu-last program. (These were of course simple union stimulus in short). This was strike one for grounds of impeachment.
n<39>                    Where's the outrage at the numbers of officers that lose their lives every year to protect the citizens from the dredge of society! Although I do not have any personal issues with body cameras, what would the excuse have been if Officer Wilson would have been wearing one that night (I'm sure there would have been one)? The "blame the officer" mentality continues and it never seems to be the criminal's fault. How exactly did our poor excuse for a President think the police should have responded to the mob burning and looting the town? Should they have asked them nicely to stop? It's too easy to sit back from the comfort and safety of your homes and make judgement calls on what the officer "should have done" in a situation after the fact.
n*<1>                        How about a high five for the MILLIONS of Cops who manage not to get shot at everyday. Don't get me wrong, policing is a dangerous job, and I have nothing but respect for the Good Cops like the young man in Michigan recently highlighted on Yahoo who managed to confront a suspect without on the Citizen's civil rights. But too often our Cops get themselves into situations they ought not be in just because they don't uphold the Constitution or are egotists or harbor racist prejudices.
s*<2>                        Sorry the missing phrase there in the second to last sentence is #$%$ all over"
s*<3>                        Hey @Viv....do you think policeman ever lie....?
s*<4>                        Why do we keep assuming ever police officer is lying? I'm pretty certain 95% of convicted criminals jailed right now will say they are innocent, so who do you believe the 1 in 100 bad cop or the 9 out 10 lying criminals.
s*<5>                        "The "blame the officer" mentality continues and it never seems to be the criminal's fault."
s<40>                    Perhaps the Secret Service Officers should be disarmed?  As usual, the president has picked the wrong side of the issue again.  This man is so consistently wrong that is truly amazes me.  The training should go to the thugs in the Black Communities who have no respect for laws nor those who enforce them.  Why is all this #$%$ going on because the law enforcement officer acted properly and the good guy is alive.  What a screwed up brain this president has.
s*<1>                        He is just a typical white hating N'er that BS'ed a bunch of people into electing him.    Bottom line.
s<41>                    People have not noticed that America is going the route of becoming a police country, it seems the police are above and beyond the law they swore to protect. If you look at a officer wrong these days you risk getting shot (especially if you are a minority), most of these new officers are not being trained properly and are then sent into communities where they feel threatened because no one looks like them so the first response is to shoot, proper training is needed and more diverse officers in communities are also welcomed.
n<42>                    Unless you are a true criminal just don't mess with the Police you will lose. We the people are not able to deal with the Police or there fellow officers they have the law on there side as crooked as it may be. When you see them walk the other way if you can not say yes sir no sir and move on as quickly as possible. Never give them an inch they will hurt you. Do not get me wrong but only a very small percentage of the Police Officers are mean, abusive or simply dangerous but as concerned Citizen stay away and be careful then usually you will be safe and remember others are watching so do the right thing. You can always sue them after they let you go...
n<43>                    Where is the hue and cry for the black man killed by the police in Jacksonville, FL this past week.  Where is Jessie and AL and Attny. Crump?  Where is Obama?  Why is there not a cry for justice in Chicago?  Black on Black crime is the problem, not Police on Black.  But, that doesn't buy votes.  Perhaps the cops should have engaged the rioters with water hoses, , as they did back in the 60's.   I don't advocate the militarization of the police, because it sends the wrong signal however, this has been done thru grants to local police depts. at the behest of Homeland Security.
s*<1>                        Where is your ignorance for white on white crimes when the kids shoot up the schools dc ? How would you know anything about police on black? Are you black? It is funny how so many ignorant people like you always jump on the computer and pretend you know are understand what others go through, go back to playing your video games
s*<2>                        This is not Obama`s duty at this point in time he is not doing his job as a president
s<44>                    Not just training! SELECTION might be a good place to start. Some of these guys are incredibly aggressive and lose their tempers with little or no provocation. I have witnessed it myself observing cops dealing with teens. I dont want to hear this bs "Theyre only human.." They need to have the patience of highly trained professional social workers and excellent presence of mind. And many of them dont, they lose it like bar thugs, I have witnessed Cops beating kids then charging the kids with 'Battery' Its outrageous. Then they wonder why some kids want to get revenge.......duuhhhhh!
s<45>                    How about a review of the violence in the black community? Has mr. obama considered that yet? Has mr. holder looked at the entire picture involving young black militant males like michael brown? It is so easy to blame a Police Officer. How many Police officers died in the line of duty this year? How many of the diseased Police Officers received the support of the justice department this year? Where was mr. holder when the Akron, Ohio Police Officer was killed by a black male waving a gun in a bar? Where was mr. obama, al sharpton, and jessie jackson in this matter in Akron Ohio? Street punk thugs assaulting people and Police Officers is ignored. But street punk thugs like michael brown are suddenly immortalized as innocent by the black sentiment. Now this has become the race card. Segregating specialized treatment for street punk thugs. This is political grand standing by obama, holder, sharpton and holder. Time to stop the show boating and get real with the black community in Ferguson Missouri! The word, Peace and Calm!  What do they mean. They certainly are not part of the understanding of which they are meant!
n*<1>                        Are you saying there shouldn't be oversight here, when there clearly needs to be? That police should be trained to properly use the military grade equipment they're receiving? Why do you have to bring race into this, particularly with this ugly "us vs. them" mentality you seem to have?
s*<2>                        What in the hell does your first question have to do with anything? What about white supremacy? Oh, and what about white supremacy? Oh yeah, and what about white supremacy? Your ignorance is overwhelming.
s*<3>                        Those you mention should run to every incident in America????? What are white leaders doing????? You want to dissect every aspect of Brown but don't want to dissect the inconsistencies in Wilson's statements.....  Those leaders you mention have been working to curve violence in black communities... If you were really in tune with what black leaders do you would recognize this.. What if the President would have said burn it down???  Damn if he do damn if he don't.........
s*<4>                        Of course Obama and Holder hasn't. They ONLY see blacks as still being the lesser of humans that fall victim to the whites. They're stuck in the slavery days and still think whites are more racist than anyone. Do the whites have a version of the NAACP? Do the whites have a white version of the BET tv channel? Do the whites have a version of the Miss Black American Pageant? If the whites had anything remotely close, The blacks would scream racism. WET tv channel- white entertainment television, Miss White American Pageant. When a black cop kills a white crackhead, Do the whites scream racism! Hell no we don't. Killing ANY or ALL punk criminals saves the tax payers money which is something the majority of those protestors don't know about since they live off of the Government!
s*<5>                        George:   Concur.   Let the "black" caucus, Sharpton, Jackson, NAACP start addressing the G.D. black violence.    Go preach!!!!!!!
s*<6>                        What about all of the government workers??  I notice most races in America have a TV channel....Bet was the first channel blacks could view content they enjoy.. BET is owned by white.... If black is killed unjustly tax payers will still pay... Whites are bringing up slavery... How many unarmed whites are killed by black cops with multiple shots compared to unarmed black killed by white cops with multiple shots?? If you accept cop killing be it white or black cop on black or white citizens that is your prerogative not to protest... That do not mean everyone else have to accept it...
s*<7>                        Everything in America is the Presidents business.... His title is "The President Of The United States"........ What have the President done to you personally to harbor so much HATE????  People want to say what black leaders are not doing while not knowing what they are really doing.....
s*<8>                        debo, I don't care what color a punk criminal is. A dead criminal is the best criminal.
s*<9>                        Noah. A review of the black community. Let's get mr. obama and mr. holder involved in the south side of chicago. Where the crime of murder by the black community runs rampant. In six years of mr. obama and mr. holder serving in our us.s government. Nothing has been done to stop this outrages killing there. Both mr. obama and mr. holder have turned a blind eye to these critical on going problems in the black community. As for the military equipment the Police are are receiving. I definitely agree that the police should be trained to use it responsibly and correctly. As for the opinion that race has been brought in to this comment. It was brought in the moment the black community protested that Darren Wilson was not indicted. And still the protestors are in denial after the forensic evidence proved that Police Officer Darren Wilson was telling the truth. Wanting revenge because you want to believe other wise, is racist. You don't see white people protesting when a Black Police Officer shoots a white man. Do you? No. You don't. And white people don't riot, loot, shoot, burn and destroy a city like Ferguson Missouri. They don't disrupt the economic well being of a city either. If you believe there is, us vs. them. Then I ask you to look at the statements that the protestors are making. Where do you see white people protesting like this? Yes. Let's bring america together. That means every one start obeying the laws. Not making the laws up to suit themselves. Stop protesting. And start cooperating with law enforcement.
s*<10>                        I can't stand how people love to harp on black on black crime like white one white crime or mexican on mexican crime doesn't exist. Please stop!
s*<11>                        Point Taken........ 80 percent of white kill white............
s*<12>                        Jeff you live in the United States Of America..... I wonder what criminal acts you have committed in your life.... Only you know so "A dead criminal is the best criminal".....
n<46>                    I think body cameras are a good thing, they will bring more accountability to police and it is a way of increasing the public trust as well as decreasing complaints against the police. One Police Department in Minnesota had 90% less complains after the institution of body cameras for their force. I am a 2nd amendment lover, fisher, hunter, boater, camper, and am all for police using outdated or recycled military equipment. Also, I think Obama is one of the worst presidents we ever had, probably after FDR.
s*<1>                        Did the police do anything different with video, or is it that people can see how idiotic they behaved that reduced the complaints?
n<47>                    Look I don't like Obama but I will tell you why some of this is good. Studies have shown that Police Departments whose officers wore body cameras had decreased complaints. In fact, one PD in Minnesota had as many as 90% less complaints after the fact. Furthermore, police should be held to the same standard we all are held to. In my state, an officer was at a bar on the job, hit and killed someone, fled the scene, and all charges were dropped. I respect cops, and like what they do, my cousin is in the academy right now. But I think they should have some more accountability. Most cops are good its only the bad ones you hear about. By the way, I love guns and the 2nd ammendment, I have no issues with police using recycled military gear, and I believe the young generation should be taught how to respect police and respect each other to make America a better place.
n<48>                    More than training police the USA needs social programs to educate those criminals. If the governments pays them unemployment, make them do social work for the money. I'm sure they'll rather work than help others. Keep them busy doing something good for the USA.
s*<1>                        sorry but I think they rather sit home and collect the money   lol

s<49>                    Now Obama is saying the police "military style" response in Ferguson, sparked the outrage.  What?  It was the police that set all their own police cars, other cars on fire.  They broke into and ransacked all the stores. Obama is the biggest contributor to racism in this country than any one.  He and Holder are fueling the civil unrest.  It distracts from the other inefficiencies in his administration. He wants this to continue hopefully till 2016.  So he can slide out leaving the country divided.  Nice going Obama. Conquer and divide. Your goals from day one.
s*<1>                        It is "Divide and conquer", not the other way around.
s*<2>                        Yep, you are correct. Sorry W, got my fingers ahead of my thought process.

s<50>                    Pull the police out of the hoods, then lets start the discussion from there. I know, a lot of good people in the hood that need protecting, but there should have spoke out against this violence a long time ago.
s*<1>                        By their silence, they are supporting them.
s*<2>                        Unfortunately, no one is going to take the police out, and the police have no right to strike. But if enough police band together in protest, maybe they can refuse to answer calls in areas where they are being unfairly attacked in the media.
s*<3>                        In a city near where I live, the illegals literally took over the area. If the fire department showed up, they would steal and vandalize the equipment. It got so bad the city said no fire or rescue could enter this area until enough police were on hand to protect the other services. After a few lives were lost, the other folks who lived there said enough is enough, and pulled together and had the city pass laws and ordanances to rid these rodents. Less than 3 years later the community is flourishing and becoming a great place to live.
s*<4>                        actually you only need to pull the white cops and Hispanic cops out of the hood, and let them police their own hoods, and then you will see shootings on a whole go down all over the nation,,,because simply put people do not shoot their own,,,period,,,and everyone with a brain knows this,,,,
s*<5>                        Don't shoot their own? That was by far the lamest comment I have seen yet. Congratulations you've made the honorary stupid award.
s*<6>                        Of course they shoot their own.  Have you never seen the black on black statistics?!?!?  And of course, if you watch the news you will see that every race shoots people of their own race.  You, John, are a boob.
n<51>                    WOW! Obama is late to the party, this has been an issue for years! Did you know that many small police departments have received weapons and guns because some one higher up got greedy at these bargain bin prices and ordered too many!
n<52>                    I think Obama should tend to other matters instead of getting in the middle of Ferguson. Police should have the right to arm themselves with whatever they can to protect the people who are not looting, burning cars and buildings. Because trouble makers come into a town or city and stir the pot to cause more trouble, and the media makes headlines about it.The president gets in the middle of it. The police should SHOOT anyone caught looting or trying to burn the town down. Mr. President, worry about important things like all the problems we have in the United States. Keep your nose out of local police affairs. If you really wish to get involved, come down on all these low lives who have NO regard for the court decision.
s<53>                    72% of African American children grow up without their father. When will they protest?
s*<1>                        Man, you are DUMB.
s*<2>                        RACIST
s*<3>                        jerome and Super genuis, both of you are either ignorant or you're a lawless ()igger!
s*<4>                        little hard when the mother doesn't even know who the father is
s*<5>                        SUPER GENIUS, racist facts?  Interesting perspective.  Looks like you weren't the last one in line so you could get your head buried.
s*<6>                        Is he wrong with that statistic or do  you just not like what it means?
s*<7>                        Thats the way Roosevelt designed the welfare system, Pay attention!
s*<8>                        What is dumb is that you morons believe statics equate to facts, or that an uncited statistic is even legitimate. The idiocracy has arrived, and it's name is conservatism.
s*<9>                        @Jerome, I'm not saying what Harry stated is true, but for the record, STATISTICS do amount to facts, that's what makes them statistics, that they aren't opinion, that they're facts in a quantified form. This may not be true statistics, but statistics are still facts.
s*<10>                        Andrew, statistics amount to facts only in the minds of the ignorant, which I guess includes you. Statistics are used to make arguments, they do not "say" anything in themselves, especially when deliberately separated from their context and methodology, as Harry has done here.
s*<11>                        That isn't the fault of statistics Jerome, that's the fault of the words people attach to them. 50% of all people on this earth are men. The number of men and women in this world are facts, and 50% is the statistic associated with that fact. Statistics that aren't lies are facts, the implications people make with them are the lies. You need to apologize to math.
s*<12>                        @Jerome, you need to go back to math class, statistics are 100% FACTS, what you do with them and how you possibly mislead someone with those facts is up to the person publishing them.  Statistics are used to run companies, write laws, figure out what the best pickup line is and many other wonderful puproses.  Only the blissfully ignorant ignore statistics.  I have no idea if the statistic quoted is true, I just find it funny how someone is labeled a racist simply for point out something that could very well be true.
s*<13>                        Andrew, your statistics fail to define what a man is or compensate for those who do not relate to either category. You example just helped prove my point.
s*<14>                        No John, statistics are not facts, and no amount of whining about it is going to change that FACT. Have you never noticed why so much right-wing propaganda is so heavily reliant on statistics? It's because they are masquerading OPINIONS as facts, which they know very well will be enough to convince the ignorant of anything.
s*<15>                        Jerome, seriously, statistics are not facts???  11% of the population is Black, 50% of murders are committed by Blacks. Black unemployment rate approx 11%. 54% of Black people graduate from High School.   Please do explain how these are "opinions" and not FACTS.    They could be incorrect facts, but they are by no means "opinions"
s*<16>                        @john Whose a(s)s did you pull those numbers out of? Keep your hands out of other people's a(s)ses!
s*<17>                        Opinions are often paraded as facts by those wishing to promulgate a point with no basis in actual fact or statistical authority.
s*<18>                        The bottom line is white America created the problem, now face the consciences!
s*<19>                        GC, who implied statistics are made up? I implied descriptions of methodology and context in collecting statistics are deliberately disregarded in order to broaden their rhetorical applicability. They can be used in ways that equate to lies, but in of themselves, they are not lies.
s*<20>                        @Mofoka  -  The US labor statistics, the US FBI crime statistics, and the US Census data.  Truth hurts don't it.  
s*<21>                        Jerome, there are lies, damn lies and statistics but statistics cannot be racist nor dumb.  Liberals and conservatives use and abuse statistics to advance their agendas.  The difference is the liberal tends to resort to using dumb, moron and idiocy rather than attempt to refute made up or out of context statistics or statistics derived from improper methodology.  I suggest it is due to a lack of imagination or motivation..
s*<22>                        Jim, your point of view is worthless because it is based on irrational conjecture and cannot be evidenced by any data in the real world. Make up your own definitions to words on your own time and keep them to yourself, because the rest of us have no time for such nonsense.
s*<23>                        Jerome
s*<24>                        They got their Baby Daddy, He may stay at the Pen, But he still the Baby Daddy.
s*<25>                        GC, statics aren't facts. They are units of data. Do you need me to describe the difference, or do you still have that dictionary of your on hand?
s*<26>                        F U ho bama!!!
s*<27>                        @ Jerome, now your just being stupid.  Saying Statistics are not facts is like saying books are not words.  ITS WHAT THEY ARE MADE OF.  Holy #$%$ you are full of dumb.
s*<28>                        John, books and words are two different things. But thanks for demonstrating that the commenters here aren't the only conservatives on this site that don't know whatThe#$%$ they're talking about and instead make it up as they go along.
s*<29>                        So whats in a book?  Come on, your almost there....... WORDS.  LOL
s*<30>                        WELL jerome, I'M SURE, IF ANYONE WOULD KNOW HOW TO LIE IT WOULD BE YOU.
s*<31>                        John, what's in a car? Screws. Does that mean you can ride a screw to your next Tea Party hate rally? You're an idiot.
s*<32>                        Erudite comments: "You're an idiot"?
s*<33>                        Jerome, It would appear you have the worthless point of view and typical liberal way of expressing yourself.  No wonder no one can get anything done when a liberal is involved.
s<54>                    Great no problems with this as it would maken them the ultimate individuals within the realm of serving and protecting. And at the same time to cover other issues on the other end of the spectrum, provide parenting classes so that the younger generations learn to be accountable anr responcible in their actions. Plus provide some guidance to the news media as to Un bias reporting so that all of the facts are up front and honest. Then find some way to provide these intercity folks something to that is positive in their lives and not willing to go on tv and burn down where they live. Train the politicians.........
s<55>                    The golfer that thinks himself king can order all he wants, it does not mean anything, zip, nada. No one is listening, NO ONE, NOBODY, because you are a pathological liar. 
s*<1>                        race hustler, you mean like rush, the GOP, and company ?
s*<2>                        2TALL you are obviously an ignorant race hustling cretin to which TedDaBear was referring.  Got it, roach ?
s*<3>                        At least Obama didn't send 241 intentionally unarmed Marines to their deaths while they slept. ;-)
n<56>                    Civil rights advocates have long pushed for all police officers to wear the cameras, to prevent against excessive use of force against civilians. Brown's parents announced a campaign to equip officers with cameras. "Now this is a good thing to protest for, PEACEFULLY WITHOUT BURNING, LOOTING AND STEALING. AND WHEN THE CAMERA SHOWS JUST WHAT HAPPENED AND IT'S NOT WHAT YOU WANT, ARE YOU A$$HOLES STILL GOING TO PROTEST AND BE CRAZY AND REPEAT FERGUSON????? SURE YOU ARE BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW ANY BETTER."
n<57>                    I don't know, if I were president I may worry less about this and more about the fact that everyone KNEW there would be rioting and looting and how not enough was done to stop it/prevent it.  It is as though they were permitted to destroy the community, to ruin the lives of business owners, to steal and plunder etc... Mike Brown wasn't shot because the police have armored vehicles, he was shot because he punched a cop whilst walking in the middle of the road high carrying stolen goods.  Don't want to get shot? Don't assault cops (also not stealing could help too).
s<58>                    I wonder if Obama is going to put in for more training of the minority youth in and around ST Louis seeing as how a group of Black and Hispanic teenagers just beat a white guy to death with hammers there this weekend,(See Zemir Begic) Of course we will never hear this day in and day out from our liberal media. " White Man Unfairly Killed by Racist Black and Hispanic Teens" Where is Al and Jessie and all the rest of the crack pot race baiters when you need them, oh wait, no black people can be racist, right!
n<59>                    Lets not arm the police-let looters burn and loot and the police will just stand there and let it happen.  Call it the Obama Doctrine of  defusing situations, written by Rev. Al and his cohorts.
n*<1>                        So you are saying tear gas and basic riot gear is not enough?
s<60>                    Of course "da-braaaaaaduuuuur" do nothing pres (except give away cell phones to his "kind" at tax payers expense) wants to TAKE AWAY armament from the local police, that way his braaa-durrrrs and sis-taaaaars can just burn down businesses, buildings, loot all the stores, steel, and rob without the poooooolices stopping them. He is a example of "ghetto" protection, NOT justice.
s<61>                    police need to stop responding to calls. let criminals do whatever they want where they want. Then when people come to them begging them to do their job tell them to police the streets themselves.
s<62>                    Zemir Begic was heading home from a bar in St Louis when a group of black teenagers surrounded his car and began banging on it. The 32-year-old unarmed white male stepped out of the vehicle, only to be yelled at and set upon with hammers, striking him in the head, abdomen and face and leaving him fatally injured. The suspects are described as being a group of black males by the St Louis Post-Dispatch BUT Police Chief Sam Dotson stated the attack was not racially or ethnically motivated.
s<63>                    Let me see if I understand this correctly.
s*<1>                        The right to protest, is part of being an American and has led to many of the greatest social accomplishments this Country has ever claimed.  The fact that a small percentage of protests turn into riots is not a justification for suppressing protests. 
s*<2>                        The solution is simple. Don't riot. Conduct a LEGAL protest all you want. But once you cross that line, expect to be met with force. The police are usually severely outnumbered in those situations.
n*<3>                        Yes, and there's a difference between force and deadly force.  An automatic weapon quickly becomes deadly force.
s<64>                    Google this - "Zemir Begic" - "Libs and blacks kucf up everything" They're poison.
s<65>                    This problem started with Lyndon Johnson and the great society. He stole my social security dollars and started paying people not to work. There the old axiom, and idle mind is the devils workshop.
s*<1>                        you forgot  "do-da-do-da"
s*<2>                        Go through the BLACK COMMUNITY during the day, nothing going on.  Go through at dusk and the swine are starting to wake up and move around.  The thugs will roam and slither throughout the night and upon daylight will start to disappear.  They shoot, cut, rape and do drugs.  Sale of drugs is the method of survival.
s<66>                    Mike Brown was shot because he fought with a cop, after assaulting a store clerk, after stealing from a store. But, because his skin was dark and not light, we ended up with weeks of rioting and looting and other destruction. All by people trying to make a martyr out of a hoodlum, based on the testimony of an accomplice. 
s*<1>                        fist fighting is bad.  murdering children is worse.
s*<2>                        It's funny how you conservatives can't get overt the fact the the alleged store "robbery" has nothing to do with anything. It's almost as if your entire point of view falls apart with out. Do you think people can't tell you're grasping for straws?
