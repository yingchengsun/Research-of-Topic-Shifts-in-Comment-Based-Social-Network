s<1>                    I wonder what would happen if all police officers would walk off the job for one week?  After the stores were empty, everything was burned down, and havoc covered the US, maybe some of these idiots would wake up.  I haven't had all happy experiences with the police, but my idea of trouble is being followed right after I was doing 50 in a 35.  Ive never been in danger of being shot, or beat up...but of course Ive never robbed or assaulted anyone , or done drugs, ever been arrested, or been in jail, but Im an old guy.  Nowadays it seems every other person has been in jail for something.  I think these guys are needed.
s*<1>                        Fred, someone like yourself makes too much sense for these ignorant people to understand.  But I must admit that it would be fun to sit back and watch what would happen if officers were able to go on strike in these people's neighborhoods only.
s*<2>                        Same thing will happen when they are on duty.  Crime will happen.  Just no janitors to clean up.
s*<3>                        That would be awesome. I could finally open my Cadillac ATS Premium sports sedan and see what that baby can really do.
s*<4>                        Society functions not because we have police officers but because most people act in a decent honest manner.
n<2>                    All this does is to make the police officer an easier target. The Criminals have the weapons they obtain from the military black market, Uzis and AK's and M16's. what are the police suppose to do, turn their back when they see a black doing something wrong, Just because he is black. I am getting the feeling that it might be better for the black community to police itself. They don't want to follow any rules of conduct or community talks unless they are about what "they" want, not about how the people should follow the police commands or conduct themselves in a manner as not to invite the police to act as police. But What do I know, I went through the race riots, the black panthers farce and the I am black and better then you attitude, for the last 30-40 years, It an't got no better. I will say this though, the hate for toward whites from blacks of the lower class has gotten worst. There is an almost palatable feeling of anger when going in an area of many blacks or mostly black community This feeling is starting to move out to the urban areas of cities. Has any one else felt it or am I just feeling something that isn't really there?
n<3>                    Fail to follow orders issued by a police officer and your chances of becoming hurt or dead increase by orders of magnitude, regardless of your skin color. Michael Brown would be alive if he did as he was told - albeit in a jail cell, but alive. Period. As for the military equipment provided to the Ferguson area law enforcement agencies actually being deployed...well duh... the ''demonstrations'' and rioting ironically proved the need for such equipment in an urban setting. The thinly veiled pandering by leftist politicians is nothing short of astounding...military style equipment made looters and rioters feel bad and intimidated - sooooooo....we should rethink giving law enforcement the tools they manifestly need to quell mob violence. The infantile or at least adolescent thinking and policy making of the left would be laughable, if it were not so completely predictable that the boomerang is going to come back and hit the rest of us squarely  in the head. Here is a news flash for those offended by a "militarized" police force - don't loot and riot, don't celebrate thuggery, don't swallow the fetid pabulum served up by the likes of Al Sharpton , or respond to that type of race-baiting with violence / intimidation and the military style equipment you find so offensive will gather a heavy layer of dust from lack of use..... a layer of dust thoroughly welcomed by the  law enforcement personnel equipped to use it.
n<4>                    The camera's are a good idea both in the car and on the officers, if Wilson would have had one on there would have been video proof of the incident, on the other side of things what are we supposed to do go back to the days when the all the police had were shotguns and pistols and were totally out gunned by criminals who had AK's (Hollywood shootout comes to mind) and other military gear?
n*<1>                        There would have done the same thing.  They would say the camera was rigged.  These people do not understand truth, ony what they want.  Obama change includes making the Blackman more rebelias not smarter.
s<5>                    Yes ... the illegal mus*lime continuing to blame the cops and everybody but the dam perpetrators themselves.  If the jungle bunnies could be taught and made to obey even the basics of the laws most of the problem would be solved.  How in hell long is congress going to let this IDIOT keep screwing up everything he touches.  Had he kept his F ing nose out of this and the Martin case half these problems would not be happening.  Two GD thugs getting away with acting like complete animals.  Cops should just say to hell with it ... do what they can to stop but if they are threatened just walk away and let the animals eat each other.  What he should have done is told Jackson, Sharpton, Holder to mind their own F ing business as keep the he!! out of there totally.
n<6>                    Body cameras on law enforcement officials sound great. But let's also make sure that all the convicted criminals are required to wear them as well, both in jail and when they are released. While you are at it, perhaps politicians should be wearing them as well, after-all, the voters have the right to see and hear what is being said behind those closed doors. (Fair is fair, so make sure you level the playing field, before you start playing this intrusive game.)
n<7>                    I'm all for police officers to wear video devices... but $75 million for UP TO 50,000 cameras is ridiculous to say the least. I can equip exactly 50,000 officers with rugged mini 1080p hd cameras for $10 million. Government is paying $1500 per camera! Will the officers be wearing Canon DSLR cameras? I think not. The camera pictured above is no more than $100. Many officers today wear a wide angle HD camera called a Mobius which costs $68. If I buying 50000 units, I'm paying $50 each. Can I get a vote to run our country's finances... I'll get Autobahn quality roads too
s<8>                    Where were the Civil Rights Advocates????
s*<1>                        Great post.
s*<2>                        Those deaths will not advance the race card agenda
s*<3>                        This is why white people should arm themselves.  Do not become a statistic to these animals.  Remember, death is forever!
s*<4>                        White deaths by Black perpetrators never matter or are reported because it is inflammatory! LOL! That is the joke and White idiots believe it too! Black people are killers and hate White people. They want to rob them of their very lives and jobs just because the can. They do not want their jobs because they are losers on welfare but the hate is what they think makes them matter!
s*<5>                        Channon and Hugh couldn't be victims of hate crimes because of their skin color....
s*<6>                        Any malicious assault resulting in disability or death by a party of differing race, should be classified as a HATE CRIME. 
s*<7>                        Victims should have equal rights to perpetrators.
s*<8>                        Yes, the perps were charged and sentenced....to death even.  The issue people are upset about isn't the "crime" itself...I mean we've had plenty of horrible crimes.  Look at Jeffrey Dahmer.  It doesn't get much worse than luring people to your home, just to eat them for dinner/a midnight snack.  The issue is that when certain people do certain things they are NOT charged, they get off free.  These boys were sentenced to death...GOOD.  The legal system "worked."  People are saying it doesn't "work" for them... no one will get charged, they will go free with no reprimand what so ever.  Again, it's not the crime... it's how an incident is HANDLED.  This is a horrible crime.  I'm glad they caught the perps and they have been charged and sentenced.... that is LEGAL justice.  Some feel they will never get the same benefits of "justice."  THAT is what this is about.
s*<9>                        Killing michael brown was not getting away with something, It was doing his job!
s*<10>                        @Edward
s*<11>                        Dahmer didn't sexually torture and molest his victims.
s*<12>                        Evidently, Civil Rights Laws were written for BLACKS.   I have NEVER in my life been prejudice, but this #$%$ with Ferguson and OUR President and administration is turning my stomach......
s*<13>                        not my kids they were ANGELS they would never do nothing like this
s*<14>                        Yup, I remember reading about that. Around the same time the little white baby was shot in the face in Atlanta because the mother didn't have any money for them to steal.
s*<15>                        I read about this some time ago. This was a HATE crime but Holder does nothing. These people were brutalized because they were white. Period. Under Obama and Holder hate crimes are only white on black, don't you know.
s*<16>                        There were no  outcry that I remember but werent those two white.Whites dont randomly loot and burn their homes and businesses down to spite a law or to say their persons were killed.
s*<17>                        @Nomorelies, the perpetrators in your story were charged and sentenced while the killer cop Wilson walked free! What's your point?
s*<18>                        They were arrested, charged and convicted what protest did you want? Were you there... protesting? Why not? Dumb (s)(h)(i)(t).
s*<19>                        @ Edward - every black person in the U.S. is a perpetrator, or a future perpetrator.
s*<20>                        Remember, you white liberal idiots, it DONT make you a " good " person to love Africans................white liberals 35 years ago made that " the rule " ...........not God.  Blind Obama voting morons.
s*<21>                        What was the motive in this crime I remember reading about the murders but somehow missed the solving  of the crime and trial story.
s*<22>                        Don¡¯t understand why you¡¯re bringing this up? The perps are awaiting their fate in a jail cell aren¡¯t they?  If they walked away without a trial I¡¯m sure everyone and their mother would be out in the streets.  You people crying about looters so are the people that live there. You failed to mention the people of Ferguson also went out to protect these businesses. Where was the outrage white protesters rioted in Seattle? Funny thing about this country is when it happens to poor minorities no one care but as time goes on it happens to whites even worse. I.E. crack business model has morphed into meth.
s*<23>                        hammer - Because he's a stupid racist and doesn't know any better.
s*<24>                        Come on people. They want all whites dead. It's obvious they wanted Officer Wilson to loose that fight.
s*<25>                        Timmy McVeigh slaughters over a hundred and is made a martyr by GOP lemmings
s*<26>                        I guess when the agitators or race baitors say life matters; it's only blacks life.  These animals deserve the worst possible death.  That is evil; pure and simple.  There are no words that I can think of to offer as comfort for these 2 young people.
s<9>                    ( If the truth is no good ) just think how they will twist the vidio record up.( Lawyers will say you can`t believe what you see ) JUST ASK SHARPTON  No news on 15-16 year olds thaking hammers to a white man in Saint Louis and killing him 12-1-14 ( TRUTH  ) where is it CNN ??? Major news stations have no guts, balls, or morals. They made more money with stiring up riots.Shame on all of us allowing a one way road with no rules anymore.

n<10>                    Did the troops in Benghazi get trained on the equipment they had?  Hmmm but this government didn't aid them when the chips were down  ... you know, like they came to the aid of the black protest movement against American Law Enforcement in Ferguson, I forgot.  Did Holder provide private training to the Cartels he sold the guns to for Fast And Furious?  No wait, we can't be sure that happened obama is still keeping that information to himself or something isn't he?  Want our Law Enforcement Officers to have second rate equipment?  I don't.  There is no need for military personnel to train Police, they have sufficient instructors of their own who can easily learn to apply new advancements in weapons, communication, APC's and the like to civilian Law Enforcement.  But ... what's the use of fancy high tech equipment that could be used against terrorists like the ones that burned Ferguson when this administration won't permit it's use anyway?  IMPEACH OBAMA, do whatever you like with Holder.  Take back America.
s*<1>                        Did the Marines in Beirut in 1982 know that being sent into a war zone unarmed may be dangerous? Hmmmm........STILL waiting on that set of needed hearings into the criminal act of St Ronnie and friends
s<11>                    hey Obama, maybe you should spend some time with the police during riots to see first hand what they have to deal with and respond do!  they are not provoking these thugs, they are there too respond and ensure public safely, pure and simple.  watch the video of these thugs looting stores costing these business thousands of $!  if the looters were white and the store owners were black, then you would be going after the protesters, but you don't want to #$%$ off the black community I guess.
s*<1>                        Like Shrubbery Sr
s*<2>                        He would be way too scared to do that.  If the rioters knew he was there they would suddenly turn into little puppies till he leaves.
s*<3>                        John, some of the looters were white.  Liberal punks.
n<12>                    One should first ask why does the federal government have all this excess equipment especially Justice and Homeland Security.  These agencies have just as much or less need than locl police departments.  Research as shown that gangs are better armed then the average police force to begin with. Without a show of force how does one combat say a riot - fire bombings - looting? Both Holder and obama encouraged "peaceful protests". Considering both come from the streets one would expect they knew the protests would be anything but "peaceful".  N law abiding citizen should have anything to fear from a well armed police force. There will always be small instances where force if excessive but one should be more concerned that the two centrally controlled agencies (justice-homeland) would over react then the local police department.
s*<1>                        Man, if those protests in Ferguson were peaceful, what happens when their not.
s*<2>                        isn't hypocritical that obama is protected, along with the rest of his family, by the most militarized law enforcement agencies in America, with armored vehicles, high tech equipment, sam missiles on his roof, high powered riffles, riot gear, etc; but denies the average American and law enforcement agencies the same protection?
n<13>                    Ruh Roh! We didn't think about who those military weapons would be used against! We thought those statistics on the prison population were racist propaganda! If the police, whose job it is to protect and enforce our laws are to wear a camera at all times how about barry, whose job it is to protect this country and follow its laws and constitution, wear one also. I'm sure if we had video of every closed door meeting and conference we would find out a lot about "this most un-American" president's real motivation to his systematic destruction of this once greatest country.
s*<1>                        you mean we should have videos allowed in the closed door meetings when Republicans are kissing big business  #$%$ for donations ? It would have been a good Idea to have a video in the Bush white house when he was lying his butt off about Iraq.
s<14>                    I am so sick of Our Republican Senators Hiding from answering the Black Rioters in Ferguson. What the Mayors of Ferguson and St. Louis should do is follow the example
s*<1>                        Don't forget, though, that Mayor Daily may have also been on the mob payroll.  Of course, Obama might have been as well.
n<15>                    obama, who is protected by one of the most militarized law enforcement agencies in the country, protecting not only him but his entire family with SAM missiles on his roof, armored vehicles, the most powerful high tech equipment and  will be protected for the rest of his life, is going to deny OUR law enforcement officers and  American citizens the same protection HE HAS.  Not only are OUR law enforcement officers target of rioters, looters, protesters, and any black person screaming the race card, the government is now warning all military and law enforcement THEY are the targets of isis and obama want to demilitarize them, making it harder to not only defend themselves but innocent Americans  and their property from these rioters gone wild and possible isis threats against fellow Americans.  obama will NEVER have to face these animals, nor will HIS family.   What kind of hypocritical liar is this man.  Are WE not good enough to receive the SAME protection as he and his family?
s*<1>                        Only if your black.
s*<2>                        Rodney King.......1991 trial........Shrubbery Sr. has justice dept charge the officers with civil rights charges.........
s<16>                    This Hole thing could be fixed If the Parents of the black people would have had the respect of there for-fathers to teach there children to do the same .Did not there parents go threw the race riots of the 60's as that what they are teaching .Be- careful for what you black people wish for you mite just get it !! ASK yourself where would you be if not for all the free housing .free food , free phones , free education , free health care , free money every mouth you live like pigs!!! your homes are a #$%$ hole ,you do not keep up your yards ,garbage is pilled up outside your door because your are to lazy to take it out .Your kids ? will not go there is not there fault it is yours !!!

n<17>                    A great deal of the military surplus equipment that is here in Florida are old style, Helos, APC's, Small Arms and a whole bunch of uniforms.
s<18>                    REPOST THIS OVER AND OVER AND OVER
n<19>                    Hey, here's a concept. Don't commit crimes and you won't place yourself in negative situations. (If any of the taxpayer dollars are going to be spent on cameras it should be for those of you with previous arrest records to wear body cameras that stream the footage to law enforcement. If at any time the cameras are removed or tampered with, police will be notified. That way everyone around you will be held accountable as well and last week's verdict would have been made without question). Let me repeat this message: Do not commit crimes.
s<20>                    Executive Order -- National Defense Resources Preparedness signed by Obama. March 2012.
s*<1>                        See 1991 for double jeopardy by Shrubbery Sr
s*<2>                        one world government, spying on us citizens , DHS building fenced compounds topped with razor wire, sounds like hitler to me. its the end of days
s<21>                    I've got news, the equipment wasn't used on anyone that was home and not rioting.  You can protest, march, etc, just don't riot, loot, and burn other peoples property, or you should get tear gassed.  You all need a better role model that a guy strong arm robbing while on drugs, walking down the middle of the road impeding traffic, and getting into fights with police officers.  If this is your role model, no wonder you think your behavior is alright.  Since when do blacks not have to obey laws the same as whites?
s<22>                    Recently, a family in my neighborhood had an early morning visit from our local police department(SWAT, NTF, Gang Investigators).  The family is from the local Indian Reservation(they were kicked off the Reservation).  The dad is a young 20 something, and he was growing marijuana and selling it out of the house.  The mother, same age, knew what he was doing and is okay with it.  They have four very young children that were taken away by CPS.  SWAT had to be called in to lead because they knew there were weapons inside the house.  There were, of course: 2 hunting rifles(unregistered and modified), bullet clips, and loads of ammo.  
n<23>                    It still amuses me seeing how many people think that riot gear and assault weapons are somehow new equipment for the police. The police back in the 1920s had submachine guns (Tommyguns) and automatic rifles (BARs). As for the vehicles, MRAPs are nothing more than very well armored trucks. All of this "tank" nonsense is completely misinformed. There are some police departments with tracked armored personnel carriers, or so I've heard, but no police department in the country has anything approaching a tank (tracks, armor resistant to RPGs and heavy explosives, high-velocity cannons, machine guns, etc).
n<24>                    Training? The question should be why can't the Obama Administration work with anyone in government? Jay Nixon the Governor of Missouri State is a Democrat.  Why does Obama Administration Eric Holder always step on States laws and rights with their bizarre political stances and political rhetoric that ignore facts of the issues?  Both are lawyers .. why do none of them understand the concept of Grand Jury or Probable Cause? There was never a race issue.  Brown was captured on camera and identified as the suspect robbery suspect who assaulted a much smaller store clerk.
n<25>                    "Mundane" police activities.  Ha.  What that means is that it takes only one good punch in the nose before Officer Degree resigns.  Police departments will not bypass a person for being more educated.  That would be ridiculous.  In fact, you must have at least an associates degree to join an accredited police department or most suburban departments.  If you meet the basic qualifications and can pass all of the tests (including the background investigation, which most people can't pass), you may be given a job offer.  It has nothing to do with prior military or more educated candidates.  As a former police officer and administrator, I have found it necessary, on several occasions, to explain to former military personnel that law enforcement and the military are 2 different animals.  I once spoke with an active army ranger who was interested in becoming a police officer.  He said, "I just want to kick down doors and shoot people".  I quickly responded by telling him that we try not to do that.  I certainly hope he stayed in the military.
n<26>                    Sounds good, But his words usually ends up lying. We will see. What worries me is he wanting an all out federal police force that rivals our military, He was recorded talking about this before getting into office in 2007. So as long as he is not trying to disarm local and city police force and then trying to give federal police, HLS power over them, In a county a elected Sheriff holds authority giving to him by his county by the people in his state.
n<27>                    I have always said Law Enforcement should wear cameras. I learned in the academy that one of the agencies close to us issues cameras to be worn on the shoulder. They said that complaints of excessive force has dropped substantially since they were issued. That could be a result of two things but what is important and undisputed is that they have worked. I like the Idea because if an Officer approaches some one and they run we have good pictures of them. Which also has had a good impacted the number of assaults against LEOs has dropped as well. People tend to not run and fight knowing that they are being recorded.
s<28>                    Obama's Vision for America:
s<29>                    Lets get real here. In Ferguson there were over two hundred gunshots fired countless .rocks bricks, baseball bats, glass bottles,hammers Molotov cocktails  and any thing else that could be used to cause bodily harm to persons or properties. 
n<30>                    seems to me that we have a failure by the Obama administration to address the core problem.  If we really want to solve the problem of policing black neighborhoods, then we need police in outreach centers right in the neighborhoods that know the locals, walk beats in the neighborhoods, build trust and friendship, and arrange counseling for troubled kids.  Training cops is useless if we do not address the real problem of criminal mentality and racism instilled into youth in the black community.
n<31>                    "as a significant number of weapons and vehicles previously allocated have gone missing."  Huh?  This is beginning to sound a lot like taxpayer forfeiture laws.  I am extorted by the government under threat of force and incarceration.  The government spends my money to buy #$%$ they don't need and pass it down the line to local cops, who fence it to buy stuff they want.  How is this program any different from welfare, other than most of the money goes into making #$%$ that nobody needs or wants.  Oh right, that is just payment to the military-industrial complex for all those campaign contributions.
n<32>                    There is a country song called "Pi### in the Wind" and it's blowing all over my friends. With out "beloved President" buying 50K cameras comes the question, who get's them? There are more than 50,000 federal agents, many more on the state and local level. So if you order all of the cameras, what happens if you are the one on the totum pole that does not get a camera and something happens? Are you guilty because you did not have a camera? Is this a live feed or recorded? Who pays for all those costs? 
s*<1>                        You would have to be an idiot not to know how to use a go pro and they only cost $250
s*<2>                        Taxpayers will pay for the cameras.  Frankly this shouldn't bother you because it favors all parties involved.
n<33>                    odumer inciting a war between blacks and whites also inciting a riot between policeman and blacks  why don't his body guards have the same executive orders he's dishing out and as far as thug browns should have been parents instead of grandma wanting officers equip with body cameras they would have capture mcspadden and 4 other thugs beating a vendor with a pipe in Oct. 2014 almost all blacks want is to be above the law so they continue to steal burn kill and destroy anything and everyone they wish odumer needs to practice what he dishes out he as racist as the idiots in Mo. he fits right in odumer's a #$%$ poor excuse for any title except racist  Mo. ought to use extreme measurerments against all the rioter that all these people will understand
s<34>                    What's up with this crap that they take time out to do there black Friday. So there going to stop fighting when holydays or a certain day they want to do. WTF is that oh I'm not fighting today cause there's a big sale going on and can't miss it please. Well Christmas is next rest on that day of course. So they have the call idiots! They fight each other. those are the one's there hurting. There making them self's look stupid that's all.
s*<1>                        Are you delusional?  I've never seen a post that made less sense.
n<35>                    WHAT'S FAIR IS FAIR....If the police need to wear the cameras then I think it's only fair that criminals also wear cameras. Obama can achieve this with an Executive Order. I think every elected official should be required to wear a camera while he is on duty serving the public.  This way we can see what our politicians are doing when they are " on duty".  Hey, what's fair is fair. Actually doctors and lawyers, and teaches and business people, fireman and sanitation workers, and taxi drivers, and carpenters and plumbers.... should also wear cameras.  Hey, what's fair is fair. And we should have all our children wear cameras on their way to school, while in school and on the way home from school....just in case they accuse or are accused of some infraction of the rules.  Hey, what's fair is fair.
n<36>                    Systems to log the weapons, and training for cops to use them more efficiently against American civilians is not the issue.  The issue is the desire of cops (and their handlers) to use them at all.  The only solution is to STOP giving these professional thugs any military equipment.  Period.  If the army is needed, cops, call it in - and go back to giving speeding tickets.
n<37>                    That's YOUR hard earned money that is arming your local police departments. Is that how you want your tax dollars spent? For armaments to be used against civilians? Why is there no public accountability of our dollars spent by local police departments? The annual operating budget for every police department in America should be clearly itemized and available for public viewing on the department's webpage. This should include salaries (names not required) and overtime expenditures. Does every small town police department near a body of water need two large fast police boats? Why is every police cruiser a gas guzzling pursuit car or SUV? Couldn't half of those cars be fuel efficient and use the saved money to hire more officers? Or buy equipment to keep them safer? Or decrease our taxes?
s<38>                    First off this racists president can't fund anything, this is the job of the C.B.O. to allocate funds. He unlawfully bypassed the C.B.O once with his stimu-last program. (These were of course simple union stimulus in short). This was strike one for grounds of impeachment.
n<39>                    Where's the outrage at the numbers of officers that lose their lives every year to protect the citizens from the dredge of society! Although I do not have any personal issues with body cameras, what would the excuse have been if Officer Wilson would have been wearing one that night (I'm sure there would have been one)? The "blame the officer" mentality continues and it never seems to be the criminal's fault. How exactly did our poor excuse for a President think the police should have responded to the mob burning and looting the town? Should they have asked them nicely to stop? It's too easy to sit back from the comfort and safety of your homes and make judgement calls on what the officer "should have done" in a situation after the fact.
n*<1>                        How about a high five for the MILLIONS of Cops who manage not to get shot at everyday. Don't get me wrong, policing is a dangerous job, and I have nothing but respect for the Good Cops like the young man in Michigan recently highlighted on Yahoo who managed to confront a suspect without on the Citizen's civil rights. But too often our Cops get themselves into situations they ought not be in just because they don't uphold the Constitution or are egotists or harbor racist prejudices.
s*<2>                        Sorry the missing phrase there in the second to last sentence is #$%$ all over"
s*<3>                        Hey @Viv....do you think policeman ever lie....?
s*<4>                        Why do we keep assuming ever police officer is lying? I'm pretty certain 95% of convicted criminals jailed right now will say they are innocent, so who do you believe the 1 in 100 bad cop or the 9 out 10 lying criminals.
s*<5>                        "The "blame the officer" mentality continues and it never seems to be the criminal's fault."
s<40>                    Perhaps the Secret Service Officers should be disarmed?  As usual, the president has picked the wrong side of the issue again.  This man is so consistently wrong that is truly amazes me.  The training should go to the thugs in the Black Communities who have no respect for laws nor those who enforce them.  Why is all this #$%$ going on because the law enforcement officer acted properly and the good guy is alive.  What a screwed up brain this president has.
s*<1>                        He is just a typical white hating N'er that BS'ed a bunch of people into electing him.    Bottom line.
s<41>                    People have not noticed that America is going the route of becoming a police country, it seems the police are above and beyond the law they swore to protect. If you look at a officer wrong these days you risk getting shot (especially if you are a minority), most of these new officers are not being trained properly and are then sent into communities where they feel threatened because no one looks like them so the first response is to shoot, proper training is needed and more diverse officers in communities are also welcomed.
n<42>                    Unless you are a true criminal just don't mess with the Police you will lose. We the people are not able to deal with the Police or there fellow officers they have the law on there side as crooked as it may be. When you see them walk the other way if you can not say yes sir no sir and move on as quickly as possible. Never give them an inch they will hurt you. Do not get me wrong but only a very small percentage of the Police Officers are mean, abusive or simply dangerous but as concerned Citizen stay away and be careful then usually you will be safe and remember others are watching so do the right thing. You can always sue them after they let you go...
n<43>                    Where is the hue and cry for the black man killed by the police in Jacksonville, FL this past week.  Where is Jessie and AL and Attny. Crump?  Where is Obama?  Why is there not a cry for justice in Chicago?  Black on Black crime is the problem, not Police on Black.  But, that doesn't buy votes.  Perhaps the cops should have engaged the rioters with water hoses, , as they did back in the 60's.   I don't advocate the militarization of the police, because it sends the wrong signal however, this has been done thru grants to local police depts. at the behest of Homeland Security.
s*<1>                        Where is your ignorance for white on white crimes when the kids shoot up the schools dc ? How would you know anything about police on black? Are you black? It is funny how so many ignorant people like you always jump on the computer and pretend you know are understand what others go through, go back to playing your video games
s*<2>                        This is not Obama`s duty at this point in time he is not doing his job as a president
s<44>                    Not just training! SELECTION might be a good place to start. Some of these guys are incredibly aggressive and lose their tempers with little or no provocation. I have witnessed it myself observing cops dealing with teens. I dont want to hear this bs "Theyre only human.." They need to have the patience of highly trained professional social workers and excellent presence of mind. And many of them dont, they lose it like bar thugs, I have witnessed Cops beating kids then charging the kids with 'Battery' Its outrageous. Then they wonder why some kids want to get revenge.......duuhhhhh!
s<45>                    How about a review of the violence in the black community? Has mr. obama considered that yet? Has mr. holder looked at the entire picture involving young black militant males like michael brown? It is so easy to blame a Police Officer. How many Police officers died in the line of duty this year? How many of the diseased Police Officers received the support of the justice department this year? Where was mr. holder when the Akron, Ohio Police Officer was killed by a black male waving a gun in a bar? Where was mr. obama, al sharpton, and jessie jackson in this matter in Akron Ohio? Street punk thugs assaulting people and Police Officers is ignored. But street punk thugs like michael brown are suddenly immortalized as innocent by the black sentiment. Now this has become the race card. Segregating specialized treatment for street punk thugs. This is political grand standing by obama, holder, sharpton and holder. Time to stop the show boating and get real with the black community in Ferguson Missouri! The word, Peace and Calm!  What do they mean. They certainly are not part of the understanding of which they are meant!
n*<1>                        Are you saying there shouldn't be oversight here, when there clearly needs to be? That police should be trained to properly use the military grade equipment they're receiving? Why do you have to bring race into this, particularly with this ugly "us vs. them" mentality you seem to have?
s*<2>                        What in the hell does your first question have to do with anything? What about white supremacy? Oh, and what about white supremacy? Oh yeah, and what about white supremacy? Your ignorance is overwhelming.
s*<3>                        Those you mention should run to every incident in America????? What are white leaders doing????? You want to dissect every aspect of Brown but don't want to dissect the inconsistencies in Wilson's statements.....  Those leaders you mention have been working to curve violence in black communities... If you were really in tune with what black leaders do you would recognize this.. What if the President would have said burn it down???  Damn if he do damn if he don't.........
s*<4>                        Of course Obama and Holder hasn't. They ONLY see blacks as still being the lesser of humans that fall victim to the whites. They're stuck in the slavery days and still think whites are more racist than anyone. Do the whites have a version of the NAACP? Do the whites have a white version of the BET tv channel? Do the whites have a version of the Miss Black American Pageant? If the whites had anything remotely close, The blacks would scream racism. WET tv channel- white entertainment television, Miss White American Pageant. When a black cop kills a white crackhead, Do the whites scream racism! Hell no we don't. Killing ANY or ALL punk criminals saves the tax payers money which is something the majority of those protestors don't know about since they live off of the Government!
s*<5>                        George:   Concur.   Let the "black" caucus, Sharpton, Jackson, NAACP start addressing the G.D. black violence.    Go preach!!!!!!!
s*<6>                        What about all of the government workers??  I notice most races in America have a TV channel....Bet was the first channel blacks could view content they enjoy.. BET is owned by white.... If black is killed unjustly tax payers will still pay... Whites are bringing up slavery... How many unarmed whites are killed by black cops with multiple shots compared to unarmed black killed by white cops with multiple shots?? If you accept cop killing be it white or black cop on black or white citizens that is your prerogative not to protest... That do not mean everyone else have to accept it...
s*<7>                        Everything in America is the Presidents business.... His title is "The President Of The United States"........ What have the President done to you personally to harbor so much HATE????  People want to say what black leaders are not doing while not knowing what they are really doing.....
s*<8>                        debo, I don't care what color a punk criminal is. A dead criminal is the best criminal.
s*<9>                        Noah. A review of the black community. Let's get mr. obama and mr. holder involved in the south side of chicago. Where the crime of murder by the black community runs rampant. In six years of mr. obama and mr. holder serving in our us.s government. Nothing has been done to stop this outrages killing there. Both mr. obama and mr. holder have turned a blind eye to these critical on going problems in the black community. As for the military equipment the Police are are receiving. I definitely agree that the police should be trained to use it responsibly and correctly. As for the opinion that race has been brought in to this comment. It was brought in the moment the black community protested that Darren Wilson was not indicted. And still the protestors are in denial after the forensic evidence proved that Police Officer Darren Wilson was telling the truth. Wanting revenge because you want to believe other wise, is racist. You don't see white people protesting when a Black Police Officer shoots a white man. Do you? No. You don't. And white people don't riot, loot, shoot, burn and destroy a city like Ferguson Missouri. They don't disrupt the economic well being of a city either. If you believe there is, us vs. them. Then I ask you to look at the statements that the protestors are making. Where do you see white people protesting like this? Yes. Let's bring america together. That means every one start obeying the laws. Not making the laws up to suit themselves. Stop protesting. And start cooperating with law enforcement.
s*<10>                        I can't stand how people love to harp on black on black crime like white one white crime or mexican on mexican crime doesn't exist. Please stop!
s*<11>                        Point Taken........ 80 percent of white kill white............
s*<12>                        Jeff you live in the United States Of America..... I wonder what criminal acts you have committed in your life.... Only you know so "A dead criminal is the best criminal".....
n<46>                    I think body cameras are a good thing, they will bring more accountability to police and it is a way of increasing the public trust as well as decreasing complaints against the police. One Police Department in Minnesota had 90% less complains after the institution of body cameras for their force. I am a 2nd amendment lover, fisher, hunter, boater, camper, and am all for police using outdated or recycled military equipment. Also, I think Obama is one of the worst presidents we ever had, probably after FDR.
s*<1>                        Did the police do anything different with video, or is it that people can see how idiotic they behaved that reduced the complaints?
n<47>                    Look I don't like Obama but I will tell you why some of this is good. Studies have shown that Police Departments whose officers wore body cameras had decreased complaints. In fact, one PD in Minnesota had as many as 90% less complaints after the fact. Furthermore, police should be held to the same standard we all are held to. In my state, an officer was at a bar on the job, hit and killed someone, fled the scene, and all charges were dropped. I respect cops, and like what they do, my cousin is in the academy right now. But I think they should have some more accountability. Most cops are good its only the bad ones you hear about. By the way, I love guns and the 2nd ammendment, I have no issues with police using recycled military gear, and I believe the young generation should be taught how to respect police and respect each other to make America a better place.
n<48>                    More than training police the USA needs social programs to educate those criminals. If the governments pays them unemployment, make them do social work for the money. I'm sure they'll rather work than help others. Keep them busy doing something good for the USA.
s*<1>                        sorry but I think they rather sit home and collect the money   lol

s<49>                    Now Obama is saying the police "military style" response in Ferguson, sparked the outrage.  What?  It was the police that set all their own police cars, other cars on fire.  They broke into and ransacked all the stores. Obama is the biggest contributor to racism in this country than any one.  He and Holder are fueling the civil unrest.  It distracts from the other inefficiencies in his administration. He wants this to continue hopefully till 2016.  So he can slide out leaving the country divided.  Nice going Obama. Conquer and divide. Your goals from day one.
s*<1>                        It is "Divide and conquer", not the other way around.
s*<2>                        Yep, you are correct. Sorry W, got my fingers ahead of my thought process.

s<50>                    Pull the police out of the hoods, then lets start the discussion from there. I know, a lot of good people in the hood that need protecting, but there should have spoke out against this violence a long time ago.
s*<1>                        By their silence, they are supporting them.
s*<2>                        Unfortunately, no one is going to take the police out, and the police have no right to strike. But if enough police band together in protest, maybe they can refuse to answer calls in areas where they are being unfairly attacked in the media.
s*<3>                        In a city near where I live, the illegals literally took over the area. If the fire department showed up, they would steal and vandalize the equipment. It got so bad the city said no fire or rescue could enter this area until enough police were on hand to protect the other services. After a few lives were lost, the other folks who lived there said enough is enough, and pulled together and had the city pass laws and ordanances to rid these rodents. Less than 3 years later the community is flourishing and becoming a great place to live.
s*<4>                        actually you only need to pull the white cops and Hispanic cops out of the hood, and let them police their own hoods, and then you will see shootings on a whole go down all over the nation,,,because simply put people do not shoot their own,,,period,,,and everyone with a brain knows this,,,,
s*<5>                        Don't shoot their own? That was by far the lamest comment I have seen yet. Congratulations you've made the honorary stupid award.
s*<6>                        Of course they shoot their own.  Have you never seen the black on black statistics?!?!?  And of course, if you watch the news you will see that every race shoots people of their own race.  You, John, are a boob.
n<51>                    WOW! Obama is late to the party, this has been an issue for years! Did you know that many small police departments have received weapons and guns because some one higher up got greedy at these bargain bin prices and ordered too many!
n<52>                    I think Obama should tend to other matters instead of getting in the middle of Ferguson. Police should have the right to arm themselves with whatever they can to protect the people who are not looting, burning cars and buildings. Because trouble makers come into a town or city and stir the pot to cause more trouble, and the media makes headlines about it.The president gets in the middle of it. The police should SHOOT anyone caught looting or trying to burn the town down. Mr. President, worry about important things like all the problems we have in the United States. Keep your nose out of local police affairs. If you really wish to get involved, come down on all these low lives who have NO regard for the court decision.
s<53>                    72% of African American children grow up without their father. When will they protest?
s*<1>                        Man, you are DUMB.

s*<3>                        jerome and Super genuis, both of you are either ignorant or you're a lawless ()igger!
s*<4>                        little hard when the mother doesn't even know who the father is
s*<5>                        SUPER GENIUS, racist facts?  Interesting perspective.  Looks like you weren't the last one in line so you could get your head buried.
s*<6>                        Is he wrong with that statistic or do  you just not like what it means?
s*<7>                        Thats the way Roosevelt designed the welfare system, Pay attention!
s*<8>                        What is dumb is that you morons believe statics equate to facts, or that an uncited statistic is even legitimate. The idiocracy has arrived, and it's name is conservatism.
s*<9>                        @Jerome, I'm not saying what Harry stated is true, but for the record, STATISTICS do amount to facts, that's what makes them statistics, that they aren't opinion, that they're facts in a quantified form. This may not be true statistics, but statistics are still facts.
s*<10>                        Andrew, statistics amount to facts only in the minds of the ignorant, which I guess includes you. Statistics are used to make arguments, they do not "say" anything in themselves, especially when deliberately separated from their context and methodology, as Harry has done here.
s*<11>                        That isn't the fault of statistics Jerome, that's the fault of the words people attach to them. 50% of all people on this earth are men. The number of men and women in this world are facts, and 50% is the statistic associated with that fact. Statistics that aren't lies are facts, the implications people make with them are the lies. You need to apologize to math.
s*<12>                        @Jerome, you need to go back to math class, statistics are 100% FACTS, what you do with them and how you possibly mislead someone with those facts is up to the person publishing them.  Statistics are used to run companies, write laws, figure out what the best pickup line is and many other wonderful puproses.  Only the blissfully ignorant ignore statistics.  I have no idea if the statistic quoted is true, I just find it funny how someone is labeled a racist simply for point out something that could very well be true.
s*<13>                        Andrew, your statistics fail to define what a man is or compensate for those who do not relate to either category. You example just helped prove my point.
s*<14>                        No John, statistics are not facts, and no amount of whining about it is going to change that FACT. Have you never noticed why so much right-wing propaganda is so heavily reliant on statistics? It's because they are masquerading OPINIONS as facts, which they know very well will be enough to convince the ignorant of anything.
s*<15>                        Jerome, seriously, statistics are not facts???  11% of the population is Black, 50% of murders are committed by Blacks. Black unemployment rate approx 11%. 54% of Black people graduate from High School.   Please do explain how these are "opinions" and not FACTS.    They could be incorrect facts, but they are by no means "opinions"
s*<16>                        @john Whose a(s)s did you pull those numbers out of? Keep your hands out of other people's a(s)ses!
s*<17>                        Opinions are often paraded as facts by those wishing to promulgate a point with no basis in actual fact or statistical authority.
s*<18>                        The bottom line is white America created the problem, now face the consciences!
s*<19>                        GC, who implied statistics are made up? I implied descriptions of methodology and context in collecting statistics are deliberately disregarded in order to broaden their rhetorical applicability. They can be used in ways that equate to lies, but in of themselves, they are not lies.
s*<20>                        @Mofoka  -  The US labor statistics, the US FBI crime statistics, and the US Census data.  Truth hurts don't it.  
s*<21>                        Jerome, there are lies, damn lies and statistics but statistics cannot be racist nor dumb.  Liberals and conservatives use and abuse statistics to advance their agendas.  The difference is the liberal tends to resort to using dumb, moron and idiocy rather than attempt to refute made up or out of context statistics or statistics derived from improper methodology.  I suggest it is due to a lack of imagination or motivation..
s*<22>                        Jim, your point of view is worthless because it is based on irrational conjecture and cannot be evidenced by any data in the real world. Make up your own definitions to words on your own time and keep them to yourself, because the rest of us have no time for such nonsense.
s*<23>                        Jerome
s*<24>                        They got their Baby Daddy, He may stay at the Pen, But he still the Baby Daddy.
s*<25>                        GC, statics aren't facts. They are units of data. Do you need me to describe the difference, or do you still have that dictionary of your on hand?
s*<26>                        F U ho bama!!!
s*<27>                        @ Jerome, now your just being stupid.  Saying Statistics are not facts is like saying books are not words.  ITS WHAT THEY ARE MADE OF.  Holy #$%$ you are full of dumb.
s*<28>                        John, books and words are two different things. But thanks for demonstrating that the commenters here aren't the only conservatives on this site that don't know whatThe#$%$ they're talking about and instead make it up as they go along.
s*<29>                        So whats in a book?  Come on, your almost there....... WORDS.  LOL
s*<30>                        WELL jerome, I'M SURE, IF ANYONE WOULD KNOW HOW TO LIE IT WOULD BE YOU.
s*<31>                        John, what's in a car? Screws. Does that mean you can ride a screw to your next Tea Party hate rally? You're an idiot.
s*<32>                        Erudite comments: "You're an idiot"?
s*<33>                        Jerome, It would appear you have the worthless point of view and typical liberal way of expressing yourself.  No wonder no one can get anything done when a liberal is involved.
s<54>                    Great no problems with this as it would maken them the ultimate individuals within the realm of serving and protecting. And at the same time to cover other issues on the other end of the spectrum, provide parenting classes so that the younger generations learn to be accountable anr responcible in their actions. Plus provide some guidance to the news media as to Un bias reporting so that all of the facts are up front and honest. Then find some way to provide these intercity folks something to that is positive in their lives and not willing to go on tv and burn down where they live. Train the politicians.........
s<55>                    The golfer that thinks himself king can order all he wants, it does not mean anything, zip, nada. No one is listening, NO ONE, NOBODY, because you are a pathological liar. 
s*<1>                        race hustler, you mean like rush, the GOP, and company ?
s*<2>                        2TALL you are obviously an ignorant race hustling cretin to which TedDaBear was referring.  Got it, roach ?
s*<3>                        At least Obama didn't send 241 intentionally unarmed Marines to their deaths while they slept. ;-)
n<56>                    Civil rights advocates have long pushed for all police officers to wear the cameras, to prevent against excessive use of force against civilians. Brown's parents announced a campaign to equip officers with cameras. "Now this is a good thing to protest for, PEACEFULLY WITHOUT BURNING, LOOTING AND STEALING. AND WHEN THE CAMERA SHOWS JUST WHAT HAPPENED AND IT'S NOT WHAT YOU WANT, ARE YOU A$$HOLES STILL GOING TO PROTEST AND BE CRAZY AND REPEAT FERGUSON????? SURE YOU ARE BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW ANY BETTER."
n<57>                    I don't know, if I were president I may worry less about this and more about the fact that everyone KNEW there would be rioting and looting and how not enough was done to stop it/prevent it.  It is as though they were permitted to destroy the community, to ruin the lives of business owners, to steal and plunder etc... Mike Brown wasn't shot because the police have armored vehicles, he was shot because he punched a cop whilst walking in the middle of the road high carrying stolen goods.  Don't want to get shot? Don't assault cops (also not stealing could help too).
s<58>                    I wonder if Obama is going to put in for more training of the minority youth in and around ST Louis seeing as how a group of Black and Hispanic teenagers just beat a white guy to death with hammers there this weekend,(See Zemir Begic) Of course we will never hear this day in and day out from our liberal media. " White Man Unfairly Killed by Racist Black and Hispanic Teens" Where is Al and Jessie and all the rest of the crack pot race baiters when you need them, oh wait, no black people can be racist, right!
n<59>                    Lets not arm the police-let looters burn and loot and the police will just stand there and let it happen.  Call it the Obama Doctrine of  defusing situations, written by Rev. Al and his cohorts.
n*<1>                        So you are saying tear gas and basic riot gear is not enough?
s<60>                    Of course "da-braaaaaaduuuuur" do nothing pres (except give away cell phones to his "kind" at tax payers expense) wants to TAKE AWAY armament from the local police, that way his braaa-durrrrs and sis-taaaaars can just burn down businesses, buildings, loot all the stores, steel, and rob without the poooooolices stopping them. He is a example of "ghetto" protection, NOT justice.
s<61>                    police need to stop responding to calls. let criminals do whatever they want where they want. Then when people come to them begging them to do their job tell them to police the streets themselves.
s<62>                    Zemir Begic was heading home from a bar in St Louis when a group of black teenagers surrounded his car and began banging on it. The 32-year-old unarmed white male stepped out of the vehicle, only to be yelled at and set upon with hammers, striking him in the head, abdomen and face and leaving him fatally injured. The suspects are described as being a group of black males by the St Louis Post-Dispatch BUT Police Chief Sam Dotson stated the attack was not racially or ethnically motivated.
s<63>                    Let me see if I understand this correctly.
s*<1>                        The right to protest, is part of being an American and has led to many of the greatest social accomplishments this Country has ever claimed.  The fact that a small percentage of protests turn into riots is not a justification for suppressing protests. 
s*<2>                        The solution is simple. Don't riot. Conduct a LEGAL protest all you want. But once you cross that line, expect to be met with force. The police are usually severely outnumbered in those situations.
n*<3>                        Yes, and there's a difference between force and deadly force.  An automatic weapon quickly becomes deadly force.
s<64>                    Google this - "Zemir Begic" - "Libs and blacks kucf up everything" They're poison.
s<65>                    This problem started with Lyndon Johnson and the great society. He stole my social security dollars and started paying people not to work. There the old axiom, and idle mind is the devils workshop.
s*<1>                        you forgot  "do-da-do-da"
s*<2>                        Go through the BLACK COMMUNITY during the day, nothing going on.  Go through at dusk and the swine are starting to wake up and move around.  The thugs will roam and slither throughout the night and upon daylight will start to disappear.  They shoot, cut, rape and do drugs.  Sale of drugs is the method of survival.
s<66>                    Mike Brown was shot because he fought with a cop, after assaulting a store clerk, after stealing from a store. But, because his skin was dark and not light, we ended up with weeks of rioting and looting and other destruction. All by people trying to make a martyr out of a hoodlum, based on the testimony of an accomplice. 
s*<1>                        fist fighting is bad.  murdering children is worse.
s*<2>                        It's funny how you conservatives can't get overt the fact the the alleged store "robbery" has nothing to do with anything. It's almost as if your entire point of view falls apart with out. Do you think people can't tell you're grasping for straws?
s*<3>                        yeah... they are in Falluja facing a large militant insurgency armed with RPGs and AKs....puh-LEEZE. These are unarmed people burning a few little buildings. Its like killing a fly with a nuke instead of a fly-swatter.
s*<4>                        Why weren't you on the Grand Jury with your expertise???
s*<5>                        I agree with you regarding Brown. He assaulted a cop, the cop didn't know whether or not Brown was carrying a knife or could get a hold of Wilson's weapon, he had every right to defend himself.
s*<6>                        My sons don't strong arm store clerks for a box of cigars. My sons don't assault police officers. They KNOW better. That will never happen and I never worry about them. Most of their friends are Asian or African. They KNOW better. These are good kids with good parents. They are not rich kids. They just all have good upbringing.
s*<7>                        Tell us about how your sons don't smoke pot, have never drank alcohol before the age of 21, and never look at online porn as well, Bob.
s*<8>                        hey, mk.  maybe the police  will come to your  house and kill your father or mother or your child or  wife.  gee.  we were  in fear of our lives. how will that  work for you?
n<67>                    Let's send Obamas relatives into these ghetto neighborhoods with no body armor and tasers. What the #$%$ is wrong with this clown? We should be doing all we can to make sure police officers are as safe as they can be. I'm pretty sure you won't see armored police vehicles roll down my street. The reason is simple......the people in my neighborhood have jobs and obey the law. It's not rocket science. Live like a civilized human being and you don't have to worry about the militarized police!!!
n*<1>                        why would he care,  he has the most militarized law enforcement agency  in America protecting  him and his family.  he will never be looted, his home burned down or even have to mingle with these rioters gone wild.  he is protecting his black home boys for future democratic block of votes period
s<68>                    Friend Of Obama And Founder Of Largest Gay Rights Org Charged As Pedophile
n<69>                    This has NOTHING to do with training and military gear to police. Darren Wilson shot Mike Brown with a Glock because he was attacked by the 290 lb young man, who punched him in the face and went for his gun. When told he was under arrest (get on the ground and hands behind his back), Brown attacked the cop again. Obama and all the race baiting cowards refuse to address the real problem....the Mike Browns of the world and how they become that way. Bring on the cameras, it will show that all the police racial profiling accusations are BS.
s*<1>                        no! he was attacked by an alien of 800 pounds, with nine legs, sixteen arms and breathing fire. and he only had an air gun.
s*<2>                        Officer Wilson didn't have a Glock, he had a Sig Sauer P229 hammer fired double action  semi-auto. That's why it went "click click" when he tried to fire it while Brown's hand was on it and pushing it out of battery.
s*<3>                        I only will point to the hundreds of people who have downloaded their videos showing police brutality. It may not be race profiling, but it is police bullying, 5 to 6 bullets...
n<70>                    This looks like political pandering for Obama for both sides.First he is upset that up armored vehicles and other military type equipment are being used against the black criminals that he preciously loves.Next he plays on the fears of white people about an overbearing police with all this so-called dangerous hardware which is all protective gear to the individual officers.In Iraq we had MRAPS,up armored M1114s,and M1151s to protect ourselves against IEDs and small arms fire,its protective equipment.Same with body armor,helmets,and firearms.Over in Iraq we had all that stuff plus serveral divisions of Army and Marine Infantrymen doing patrols in towns,villages,and cities.It did not matter to the Iraqi Jihadists how much protective equipment we had they just targeted mostly the easy targets like the local population who were mostly unarmed or weak Iraqi Police and Army.Mayhem continued to this day after we left and turned over our protective equipment to the Iraqi Government.Obama is playing the traditional game of divide and conquer to distance himself from the chaos that he has created.
s*<1>                        He is a seasoned pro with using distraction to divert attention of the masses! Unfortunately, it works. He and his advisers know how long the collective memories of the voters. He does absolutely nothing by mistake, and all has a political agenda. Typical political hack.
s<71>                    Wasn't it Oblamo who told the rioters to stay the course! He assisted in escalating and advancing the rioting, arson, assault, muggings and other violent crimes by impeding his will upon the state Governor. Thus directing the governor not to send in the Guard who has been ready! I wish someone would arrest Oblamo and Holder for treason this criminal causes many of these situations and then takes the credit for it's recovery of sorts, then passes blame onto someone else! I loath and despise this criminal wannabe president so much!
n*<1>                        Exactly, they don't want the police to have rioting equipment than allow the military to take control. Obama is not standing up for the community of Ferguson or any of the other community that are under siege by these terrorists.
n<72>                    Had they actually acted like a military unit many of the stored that were burned down would still be standing.  Sorry, but that's a fact.  You don't end rioting, looting, and burning by sitting back and watching it happen.
n*<1>                        Maybe the cameras will lead to more arrests of Barry's homies.
n<73>                    Since when is it a militant stance to defend yourself?Its a human stand not a military one. Obama will be weakening our police forces just like he has the military.The police could use the cameras, it would help. 
n<74>                    OUR PRESIDENT HAS NOT BEEN ON MANY STREETS WHEN TROUBLE BREAKS OUT!!if he had he would be calling in tanks if he had them,it's very hard to turn over a armored unit,or burn it...it's very hard to shoot bullets through it...a show of force normally stops protestors from turning into rioters...I don't have a fear of the police,as I  understand others do,normal ,law abiding people normally don't have issues...rioters in furgeson ,do have because it deters them from looting.as to the cameras,if the officer Wilson had one on,i'm afraid it wouldnt matter(any more than 3 coraner reports,or csi reports)they would say it was rigged,and try to ignore the truth
s*<1>                        you sound like a fascist I would kill you as an enemy of freedom if I knew where you lived and you family kids parents and all.
s*<2>                        please come to Oklahoma city,we appreciate our police for dealing with #$%$ that cant follow the rules,if we had rioters that burned down building s ect,we would have shot them...so if that makes us a fascist...COME ON DOWN..
s*<3>                        Adam, your a weak, jobless, uneducated pimp who can't get laid
s*<4>                        And what about when the police use that force, unwarranted, on you?
s*<5>                        Its hard to believe that Yahoo won't allow passionate expletives, but would allow flat out threats by a murderer like Adam.....
s*<6>                        John Doe...really? If I robbed a store, told a cop to #$%$ off, reached for his gun while I #$%$ slapped him, ran away, then turned, with my hands up, running like I was going to hurt the cop, I would EXPECT to be harmed....
s*<7>                        My son is a crewman on a M-1 Abrams tank.....He would make short work of these
s*<8>                        Robert you believe in using deadly force on protesters who riot. Using deadly force on rioters is illegal. but you sir are a fascist and if you believe in having a tank on the streets with 75mm explosive rounds which will cause collateral damage you are no different then the rioters an you are a fanatic and extremist and a terrorist therefore killing anyone with such a mentality would be just.
s*<9>                        NO ADAM...I DONT TAKE LIVES WITHOUT GOOD REASON,burning someones house or business down,with the possibility of killing a human in that house,and destroying other peoples lives ,beating people to death with hammers(see todays news ,out of st Louis) does not set well with most people.having a tank on the street,that deters protestors from rioting,not a bad ideal...you say it's illegal to use deadly force on rioters,so if your armed,in your home and a rioter breaks in,or fire bombs your house,whats illegal about killing the animal...am I a fanatic ,or a man sick and tired of the few that think they can kill and mame without any punishment@johndoe,i think your question was aimed at me(poor choice of words on my part)I'm a law abiding citizen,if I have a problem with the police,i will take it to them legally,i'm not stupid,sometimes there are bad cops,who make poor split second actions,and some times people die (poor 12 year old shot by cops other day,reguardless of color)
s*<10>                        in Oklahoma we have open carry for firearms(and you don't see many people displaying them,in the metroplex)JOHN DOE AND ADAM,what do you think is going to happen when a cop pulls up and you are waving a gun around?if he does not view you as a threat to others ,at that given moment,he will point his weapon at you and tell you to put your hands up,if you dont comply,he will shoot you dead.my points simple,follow the law life is good,if you don't,go to jail or die...neither of you like cops,whens the last time you took a ride-a-long with one(never I'm sure)and found out how bad the human race has gotten...try it
s<75>                    Rather than Obama and Holder taking exception with the police how about this. Let's do an IQ test with the blacks in their community and whites who border that community taking into account their ability to integrate with those not of their own race? I think the outcome would make it evident that the blacks are the most prejudiced people out their and they covet their subculture, entitled life style. I never was a prejudiced white but I've arrived there after this double standard exhibition.
s<76>                    Starting today all officers going on duty in Ferguson must surrender their firearms and pick up a bucket of KFC. 
s*<1>                        Yes. The above comments proves that it's not about race and stereotypes at all in America. SMH
s*<2>                        Let the insane asylum police itself.
s<77>                    I am so ****** that Obama has lined up with Holder, Sharpton, Jackson and the disgraceful Nancy Grace in putting this man in a position that could hurt this country more than help it, the kid was wrong, it is unfortunate he had to die but he was WRONG.  Even Charles Barkley said it was the right decision.  Go figure, it appears that Obama is in the same category as Sharpton, won't be happy until their is total war among the colors.
s<78>                    As the media ignores the victims of Black Violence, that happens every day.

s<79>                    I suggest that all elected and appointed officials wear body cameras so we can see how they govern all the time.  That way they can be inclusive, not divisive...transparent instead of opaque, work together to enact laws and govern the country, instead of using taxpayer funded government lawyers to research how much action each can take without starting a constitutional crises.  Stop arguing with each other and start working together to come up with compromises that all sides can live with.  Get back to work!
n<80>                    I dont want cameras to protect me from bad cops. I want the cameras to make sure that more criminals get convicted.
n*<1>                        Typical Obama, all talk and no do.
n*<2>                        "Either way, the cameras will malfunction whenever the police deem it necessary"
n*<3>                        Cameras will protect police officers and help convict criminals.
n<81>                    Law enforcement is just that.   Equal force to subdue criminal activity is becoming impossible.   Superior force and occasional examples of such need to happen to bring peace to the community.   If an officer abuses his or her badge, and commits a murder without justification, then it is necessary to bring criminal charges.

s<82>                    The real issues facing inner city America are not being addressed specifically kids having kids and nobody raising them, etc.  We have more gang members than ever before and all armed to teeth with automatic weapons.  The inner cities will only get worse with more guns, poverty and gang members.  The gun control argument only addresses those who legally own guns and does not address the millions of gang members that walk our streets armed everyday.  Now the second admendment never sounded so smart and necessary.
s*<1>                        You don't know that illegal guns enter the black market via the people that you think are responsible, do you? Maybe you should actually do a little research in how guns become illegal instead of just buying into whatever horseshoe_t lies the right is peddling on any given day of the week.
n<83>                    For once I agree with the president " There is a big difference between our military and our local law enforcement, and we don't want those lines blurred,¡± . No matter how much people will want to advocate the protection of the law enforcement there must be a separation between the Military and the Civilian Police. If they are the same in armor , the same in training , the same in weapons , this means a military state in disguise, so spare me the critic.
n*<1>                        It doesn't matter so much how they're equipped as to who controls them.  The more say the Feds have in local affairs the more we move toward a totalitarian state.
n*<2>                        They should be more armed than the criminals, right? I mean it shouldn't be fair. Law enforcement are completely trained and operated separately already, this is just a political position/move in response to a bunch of whining jerks...
n*<3>                        Eagle.....open your eyes.  Most police officers are recent military released persons trained to fight terrorist. They are not gun shy and are not allowed to decompress because ,like everyone else they need a job. Is this enough said?
n*<4>                        thank you!
n*<5>                        Based on the replies I guess you people are missing the point... well tough times we live in...
n<84>                    There has never been any response of this type government over sight in Chicago and/or Detroit, and I don't remember Obama holding any white house meeting on the killings Chicago or Detroit, which have more killings then Ferguson.  Between all the luting, burning and/or destroying as much city, state, public and/or private property why would ban the local police Departs from receiving recycled military equipment such as vehicles and/or assaults rifles
n*<1>                        Retired:   You are so right.   Did they "really" find the perps who did the damage?   If so, make them pay.........I'm sure they have absolutely nothing, but give them Community Service for a year or so, and IF on Welfare, cut it OFF.   Too freak'in bad.   Or, send them to jail, but THAT would cost us money to feed, rec time, TV, etc., etc.
n<85>                    I wonder if you are going to mandate some sort of man training for black youth in America, that's where the problem lies.Until the black youth get out of this "everyone owes me, so im gonna take it" mindset their will always be repressed and abused by race baiting for profit Sharpton inciting riots. How sad that "Ferguson outcome" of rioting brought on by the death of a thug and criminal is this only thing blacks are able of being remembered for.
n<86>                    The use of military equipment and tactics also fits into the common practice of favoring ex-military or military police as candidates for law enforcement. Since they use a military structure and chain of command they prefer those who are already familiar with the routines. Also, they tend to bypass civilians with higher education/intelligence because they tend to get bored with mundane police activities and might question policies that seem dysfunctional. Gearing up to fight criminal enterprises like drug dealing cartels is one thing but using similar techniques against average citizens will only widen the gulf between law enforcement and the general public. When people begin to see law enforcement as the "enemy" or at least the "bad" guy something needs to be done. There was a time when police were more active and present in the community and interacted regularly with the public but budget constraints have changed that to an "as needed" response plan.  In too many cases the police respond only when summoned but when the public refuses to pay for more and better officers they have little choice.
n*<1>                        being a cop or fire employee is next to retirement.
n<87>                    As the media ignores the victims of Black Violence, that happens every day. 
n<88>                    LMAOSHIH's,,,I think we are being scammed again...It is my understanding the Goal of Homeland Security is to NATIONALIZE all our Nations indedpendent Police Forces under the Dictatorship and Rule of Homeland Security and the Dictator in the White House.You might be interested to know that your Police Chiefs and others in their chain of Command Routinely attend the FBI Academy in Quantico Virginia just for this reason. You also might like to know that under Homeland Security the Nation has been divided up into Little Dictates with a Federal Dictator at the Helm via Homeland Security....So I have no doubts,, Ferguson was going to be used or is being used to try to force Hijack of the Country by the Obama Administration.. So in my opinion this Executive Order is just another phony WINDOW DRESSING being used to appease the gullibable  and means absolutely Nothing..Those who live in New York City might remember the dozens of MRAPS driving through your City during the Pre and After Math of Hurricane Katrinia..all with Federal ID's on their sides with Gunports etc. etc. So these vehicles being spread out throughout the Country is part of the plan and this Exeuctive Order is just a way to get your eyes to look somewhere else instead of at what is really going on in my opinion...Plus if you are unhappy with the way you are being treated by your Local Police then why are you Voting for the people who give them their directions..The Mayor and City Council Members, They hire the Police Chief and basically give him his "marching orders" So why are you voting for the Politicians who expect this behavior from their Police Chief who passes this attitude and directions to the Officers in the Field???? Your paying High taxes to pay for someone to beat you up or treat you badly and then you turn around and Vote for the Mayor and City Council who directed this be done.....Not to bright are ya's! Geez....
n*<1>                        You are right, Homeland Security is the people of this countries worst enemy right now.   We just haven't seen all of it yet.     Wife had a parking ticket I guess she forgot to pay.  Homeland Security writes her a letter, the wording basically treated her like some sort of Terrorist.   Terrible direction this country is heading.   And no one seems to study history.
n<89>                    The police have done nothing wrong. One protest sign read "End White Supremacy". Exactly what is this uneducated idiot talking about. If you want to be on top then do something these protesters do not know how to do. Stop whining, go to school, get a job, pay your bills without help from the government and charitable entities, this is how you advance. Then and only then will you feel like you are in control. This sign proves racism towards whites, this sign tells the story as to why the blacks are protesting. The blacks are the racists here and the police have to subdue the crowds at all costs for the protection of the honest hard working citizens of this country.
n*<1>                        It's so much easier to smoke dope and collect free federal monies.
n*<2>                        F U ho bama!!!!
n*<3>                        Bill I sure with our members of Congress would of followed your advice and Stop whining, go to school, get a job, pay your bills
n*<4>                        If you are more outraged at poor black folks in Missouri looting stores than rich whites on Wall Street looting your future, you have been duped.
n*<5>                        I saw a sign being held by protesters in LA that read "304 officer involved killings from 07 to 14, but they never held a sign saying anything about the 67 law enforcement officers killed on duty in the FIRST SIX MONTHS of 2014. That averages out to over 1,000 killed in the line of duty over the same time frame.
n*<6>                        It is beyond ridiculous how the black leaders (including Barry) carry on about ending racism. They are the ones keeping it alive! The end of racism is pretty clear: Get an education, steer clear of gangs that use kids as 'cannon fodder', take responsibility for your own actions, teach your kids the meaning of respect (from the parents to the family to all forms of authority). Once this is in the works, the very behaviors that stereotypes are spawned from no longer exist.
n*<7>                        F U ho bama!!!
n*<8>                        Did you read the article? You really don't have a problem with police pointing rifles at citizens exercising their First Amendment Rights? Let me guess... you call yourself a patriot?
n*<9>                        D. Blake, exercising 1st Amendments does not and will not warrant rifles pointing at people. But, if you want to use Ferguson as a reference: remember, they were "PEACEFULLY PROTESTING'. So, if this is your idea of 1st Amendment activities, you are really messed up. To refresh everyone's memory: real peaceful non-violent protesting IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM RIOTING. What planet are these people from? You riot, burn and otherwise destroy other people's property, YOU ARE NO LONGER PEACEFULLY PROTESTING! You should be surprised if you DO NOT get a rifle pointed at you. What part of this is so HARD TO UNDERSTAND?
n*<10>                        Is Brown's stepfather going to be charged with inciting a riot, when he went on national TV after the grand jury verdict and told all the protesters across the country to "Burn this bi%#$ down!"?
n*<11>                        Maybe this factoid will help... Last year in Ferguson, 86 percent of stops, 92 percent of searches, and 93 percent of arrests involved blacks, despite the fact that police found more ¡°contraband¡± stopping white residents than black ones.
n*<12>                        D. Blake - and your point is???? The majority of the crime is committed by blacks, even though they only make up 14% of the population. The only reason more "contraband" was found on the whites is because they can afford it because they work.
n*<13>                        Sounds to me like they have a very inefficient way of policing Ferguson to me...
n*<14>                        Police accountability is at an all time low with inept "prosecutors" working for the defense of killer cops, trying to discredit their victims and participating in farces like the Grand Jury miscarriage of justice. Until a real trial is initiated by an independent federal prosecution, there will be no justice and no peace.
n<90>                    When Police start wearing body cameras now everyone will see what the Police have to deal with on a daily basis.All the murderers, rapists, robbers, racists, pedophiles, all the animals that walk among the good people. There also should be a place where all this video can be downloaded for the public to see and they cannot stop video from being seen just because they may be black, white, Chinese, Hispanic etc. Everyday the Police have to deal with the worst of humanity. Everything a Policeman or Police woman see's every citizen should also see. Whether it is a murder scene, drive by shooting, rape scene, car accident.
n*<1>                        Amen Brother! PBA Forever.
n*<2>                        as it the right to  see the  other side of those who wish to break the laws and be violent also!
n*<3>                        Yes, and I will go you one better.  Every convicted felon who is out of jail should be made to wear an ankle bracelet so he or she can be tracked 24/7 and if they attempt to take it off or tamper with it in any way, they go straight back to prison.  How's that?
n*<4>                        When the rocks, bottles, batteries fly like at every so called "peaceful protest" the wearing of body armor, and support vehicles makes very good sense.  In fact the use of live ammunition in such conditions of criminal rioting also makes sense.
n<91>                    The almighty, always perfect government tells us that all this military weaponry is for our own good.  Adolph Hitler and Josef Stalin told their slaves the same thing.
n<92>                    Like in our wars, we don't want to win too big or totally.  It looks bad if we win too much.  Make sure the casualties are more even on both sides so it doesn't look like we are a military state and ruling with an iron hand.  Make sure at least the citizens get a fair fight.  Give the police body armor, but publish what will penetrate it.  Give the police tazers to fight off the automatic weapons the "citizens" have.  Why oh why would anyone worth their salt want to be in law enforcement these days?  This is just how it started in Detroit.

n<94>                    Does anyone remember the bank robbery carried out in California sometime in the 90's? They were two guys armed with full auto weapons and full body armor? All the same liberals cried and demanded that our police should always have better armament than the bad guy's? Remember, they were really getting slaughtered? The police finally resorted to getting high powered guns and ammo they needed from a pawn shop so they could compete with the robbers? The genius liberals would not authorized police to carry anything more powerful than a pistol and a shotgun? Now we are crying that they have to much? Get a few ISIL over here (that will happen) with mass murders in no gun zones, malls and parks? Then watch the knee jerk once again?
n<95>                    The overwhelming majority of Americans are too stupid to realize Obama was the one that order such actions to begin with and this will only increase the work he started....more division and uproar (what he wants) will only give him justification to take further steps to militarize our police... DO YOU PEOPLE HONESTLY THINK RADICAL AGENDAS HAPPEN OVER NIGHT?? It takes years to slooowly implement the change liberals have planned. I am not saying the republicans or the tea party have all the answers. But the truth is that Obama's agenda is extreme and severely oppressive.
n*<1>                        Levi, what changes do you suggest, are you saying that the blacks want the right to assault police officers without repercussions.
n*<2>                        @ Richard
n<96>                    Blame the cops for implementing ORDER?  Same thing with immigration officials for deporting illegal Mexicans. SOMEHOW OBAMA DOES NOT WANT TO IMPLEMENT THE LAW.  For the past years, all our beloved president did is destroy everything that is good in this country.
n*<1>                        Agree with your comments except that I nor few I know would refer to him as "our beloved President".  I belong to that group which bites their tongue and awaits the day when he is no longer in office.
n<97>                    Quotes from Hillary (HITLERY) Clinton:  Do you think  she wants Socialism or do you think?
n*<1>                        Why don't we just throw everyone on welfare into private, for profit prisons and then you can use your tax dollars to hire private military companies to run them and pad the pockets of wealthy CEOs. And more military everything. That's where I want my tax dollars to go, don't you? It only takes 80% of our tax money. L
n<98>                    Could the problem possibly be the lack of values these people are learning in their homes? I've seen firsthand the amount of disrespect that even young black kids have for police, and it's taught to them at a young age. A ridiculously high amount of black kids grow up without a father and their mother is forced to work several jobs so she's never home. What if Obama and other protesters spoke out about this epidemic instead of blaming a Police Officer for protecting himself after being brutally attacked?
n*<1>                        I
n*<2>                        In police depts. that already use body cameras, filed complaints against police dropped 80%. It protects both parties and is great evidence in court. Wire them up!

n*<24>                        They will help police behavior more with appropriate standards and criminals will know they can't get away with heresay
n*<25>                        Yes and so what does the young black youth learn from watching Mom work her butt off and provide for him and no daddy around and son doesn't work because mommy will take care of him?  He learns to repeat the actions of the mia daddy - no responsiblitity! That's the momma's job.
n*<26>                        just ax dems...
n*<27>                        No Ben, the civil (rights) answer is that society has everything stacked against them, and until we dismantle this cruel economic system that holds them back, we can only expect more of the same.  I suppose you saw Brown's step-father react to the grand jury decision?  That is the example being set for Brown (the unarmed teenager), yet so many are surprised to hear that he did anything wrong, anything to provoke his own demise.
n*<28>                        Ben, there is no way to take you seriously now. One post, and respond to questions.... how hard is that?
n*<29>                        Gray, this is about a bigger issue. Not just the Browns. We all know where thugs come from.
n*<30>                        Work several jobs?  Is 'creating illegitimate babies to get more welfare' a job?  If it is, then the people I see in the cities must be making bank.
n*<31>                        @Ben NO BABY DADIES MEANS MO MONEY FOOD STAMPS, SECTION 8 HOUSING, CASH,FREE PHONES MEDICAID. NO WONDER THEY HAVE TIME TO BE ON THE STREETS RIOTING LOOTING AND JUST BEING PLAIN THUGS CRIMINALS OR WHAT EVER THE HELL YOU WANT TO CALL THEESE FINE UPSTANDING PILARS OF SOCIETY.

We have surly lost our country to a bunch of thugs. Take the country back. Do what you have too. All out internal American war. Do it now, DO NOT WAIT. Your children are depending on you, to get out and riot against this government. Take it down. Take it away. Hurry time is wasting away. Get off your ---
n<100>                    I see no problem with this.  People say they don't want a police state that seems more like military than police, then turn around and say that the president shouldn't keep military equipment from police officers.  Cameras on police officers sounds perfect also.  Officers are less likely to do dumb things, and officers get to use it in the courts to avoid having to deal with witnesses that remember things differently.  It's a win for everyone, I don't see any issue at all.
n*<1>                        @ Jeboel: There are people who will never be happy with anything Obama does. Think of it this way: What do you expect from people who are convinced that he is not even a us citizen?
n<101>                    Got sideswiped by another car on the interstate going home from work by a crazy driver.   He never looked back but had considerable damage to his vehicle as well as mine. He hit my car on the right side so I had damage to both sides. knocked off the road and into a guard rail and caught  on fire for a minute or two. Police asked if I got a tag number and I told him that at the time I was fairly busy having an accident and did not have time to run him down and get his tag number. I was then told that in case of a hit and run, I must provide a name and address of the offender in order for him to submit a report. Does that no we all will have to purchase a camera for our cars? Leave it to our fearless leaders in Washington to solve our problems. BS
n<102>                    Little Johnnie's mother was black and his father was Jewish.  Little Johnnie came home from school one day and ask his mother if he were more black or more Jew.  Little Johnnie's mother said she didn't know.  He could ask his father when he came home.  When little Johnnie's father came home, little Johnnie ask him if he was more black or more Jew.  His father asked what on earth made him ask  a question like that.  Little Johnnie said, "Well Freddie is selling his bike and he wants $50. for it.  I don't know whether to try to Jew him down or just wait till it gets dark and steal it.
n<103>                    As usual, the dumb effer is working on the wrong problem.  Holding meetings and throwing big money around because of the Ferguson riots will not solve America's culture war.  Black males between 15 and 25 account for 2% of our population and commit 55% of our murders nation wide.  That is just one crime stat. Equally depressing are stats in education, drugs, out of wedlock births, welfare, etc.  Plus, Mr. President, all the forensic evidence points to Officer Wilson's story of this tragic event being accurate.  Once again, Obama is trying to capitalize on a crisis but this time he is clearly wrong and his actions are worsening race relations in the country.
n<104>                    Does this include the purchase and distribution of military urban  assault vehicles and massive ammo purchases for the seemingly entitled but unmentioned #$%$ of the Department of Homeland Security???  Or has our Prez declared WAR upon Urban AMERICA in his usual style of ignoring the rules of engagement clause in the Constitution.
n*<1>                        When you get this revolution that you crave, I hope you get lots of action. So much action that you can't even sleep or get any rest. Oh what fun that will be!
n<105>                    I agree not by all the negative comments posted but because I been overseas where the police are paramilitary and you the posted the negative comments should be thankful that under our Constitution the police can't come into your home and drag you out just because you said the president sucks. Our police should be a civil body because I don't know the words to say it, And not a paramilitary organization as in other countries, To be truth this is what happens when the word problem that use to describe a social issue is change to there is a war on social issues. 
n*<1>                        WTH are you talking about? There are countries where police are not even armed. Where police are respectful servants. Where your rights actually matter.
n*<2>                        Yes .. And there are Country's that will spank or cane you for chewing gum and spitting it on the sidewalk be glad you live here?? so keep Complaining folks.
n*<3>                        nighthawk, that is not what we want. Keep licking boots and you will get it.
n*<4>                        @ Jason 
n<106>                    A lot of money spent on bean counting, preparing reports to be read and then thrown in the trash by different committees after having useless discussions reaching no real conclusions calling for action....government oversight committees.
n*<1>                        lets put the jails right next to the schools - it might motivate kids to not commit crimes, but it would also be easier than bussing them to their jail cell.
n*<2>                        They are too busy spending billions to the U.N. for climate change &amp; writing checks to help every other country.
n<107>                    What's a brother to do so many woodpiles in Ferguson and so few vacancies, maybe they can move into the Edward Jones Dome I hear they are igger friendly, but then dare  is the issue of nothing near by to loot and a good deal of what is has sprinkler systems and won't burn. I know lets call Reverend Al he replaced the Shell answer man He's got da answer for everything and he got an in with da lawbreaker in chief the one from well doesn't matter where he's from He lives in da white house the one the whites payed for you knows Da 1 I means. That igger got it going on he knows who is mama is and has an idea who his daddy b. He got da power to call on his igger buddy to prosecute dem white folks thinks they can shoot a brother for beatin on da POPO.  Dem fools gonna learn cant do dat #$%$ it don't fly in da hood cause we knows what justice b.
n<108>                    I know good whites.  I know good black folks too.
n*<1>                        Thank you, Chris.
n*<2>                        You're right, it's about the corporastists who sponsor the GOP who long ago moved low-skill labor over seas to avoid having to sustain the future of the middle class in this country. Poverty and increased violence is the result. I'm glad someone else around here has finally figured it out.
n<109>                    the Federal Gov.'s job is simple protect our country from outside attacks not to #$%$ be king of all 50 states and demanding local state cops to act like militaries and shoot civilians.. this moron king of ours is not in charge .. its the states .. his job is to stop illegals or any form of invasion into our  states and nation.. apparently he is doing the opposite of our will .. we seriously need to remove this dictator.. he is no king and he is no president of the united states of America our nation is already nullified by his actions.. so we don't have to follow his so called decree.. it is either death or live under a liberal muslim regime for americans  he already divided our nation and next he will abolish our laws like he did with amnesty.. please someone in office stop this traitor and his Nazi tactics of hate.
n<110>                    Well you can surely see from the statements he and his nut buddy Holder has made that they want the criminals to have more and better weapons than the cops.  I don't know what is wrong with those two people who swore to "uphold and defend" the Constitution and every chance they get, they are stepping on it and lying through their fat lips.  The oath that they took means absolutely nothing to them as long as they can get their racist agenda across.
n<111>                    Yes that's the problem, the police need more training. No reason to address the uncivilized savages who burned down the town.  What a complete and utter failure this man is. This is not a civil rights case and what happened had absolutely nothing to do with color. A violent felon assaulted a police officer and caused his own death. That is the unfortunate truth. If we had honesty in government and media that would be the story. Charles Barkley has more integrity in his big toe than our president and AG combined.
n<112>                    Won't the camera's actually be there to prove what actually happened in Ferguson?  I hope those cameras simultaneous send a recording off the camera.  I can just see it now that after a police officer is shot dead the perps now strip him to get rid of the evidence.  All these thugs with their thug friends will just get more evidence to put them in jail.  Could you imagine if Wilson had a camera on him?  It showing the "gentle giant" punching him in his squad car, going for his gun, and charging him like a bull.  I'm certain the family would still cry foul with the evidence anyway.
n*<1>                        Unfortunately, the supporters of the criminals will deny the evidence, like the strong-arm robbery we all saw on the video.  They don't care about facts and evidence.
n<113>                    I don't know what any of this body camera would do any good at all.  I watched Brown rob the convenience store and there are still 5-6 M blacks who say it wasn't robbery, or it wasn't him, or whatever.  All it will do is slow down the legal process even more than it already is, and justice cannot be served.  All it will do is increase lawsuits, and who would be a policeman after that?  I think Wilson and the Ferguson/St. Louis police did a pretty good job considering the size, and belligerence, of the opposition.  I think it would be simpler to fight ISIS, than these brain dead racists.
n*<1>                        the store owner said that it wasn't Brown in the video...spoken like a true white man - racism is alive and thriving in this country.
n*<2>                        What happened at the convenience store has NOTHING to do with the shooting.  What part of that don't you get?  You really think stealing cigarettes is cause for the death penalty?
n*<3>                        You are both morons.  The point is what good would a camera do.  Millions of people saw the video of the robbery, yet there are two distinct attitudes about what it means.  It would be the same thing if a policeman was wearing a camera.  There would always be ten different interpretations of what happened, no matter how clear cut it looked to any one entity.  Do you get it, or do you want me to draw you a picture? 
n<114>                    This was all engineered to get out of control to begin with. The ¡°powers that be¡± WANTED this to happen. So that riots and chaos could get out of control¡­so peons like you and me could sit around and argue about it¡­so we could be distracted by what¡¯s really happening behind the scenes. The American people are used as pawns in a big government agenda game. This became big news because someone WANTED it to become big news. 
n*<1>                        The government knew black people were animals
n<115>                    Why are we so afraid of our police that we need to monitor their service and protection in real time? The last thing we need is a remotely manged police force on the front lines of our disintegrating cities. The police need to make their own decisions based upon the situation at hand. There are always those that will disagree and make a ruckus, but to place police protection of lives and property in the hands of insulated micro-managers is a greater danger to society.
n<116>                    There was no military response. The lib goobener refused to allow the National Guard to deploy to protect the town. Most if not all of the destroyed businesses would still be there had he done that.  It depends on Missouri law but usually a goobener can deploy them without the local bureaucrats asking for them. Brownhole was a punk &amp; the rioters, looters &amp; instigators should be held accountable &amp; given long prison time. The police should not be militarized because they are a civilian agency that does not have &amp; should not have that kind of training. Militarizing the police has never ended well for the citizenry. I can think of only one instance where a police force has been partially militarized to effectively help defend, one critical term to describe the difference between police &amp; military, against foreign &amp; domestic terrorists &amp; criminals.
n*<1>                        The image of the Humvees is a military convoy and not the police
n*<2>                        You have no idea what you are talking about.  A police agency is a paramilitary organization that  puts itself between the public and the bad guys.  Equipment given to police agencies allows them to equip themselves with equipment that small agencies could not afford.  I retired from an agency with about 1,000 officers but that included corrections personnel.  It was a huge benefit for our officers to be equipped with personnel carriers, aircraft and other means of protection.  Your sentences do not make sense.  I don't remember where a law enforcement was militarized by the federal government.  Law enforcement agencies sometimes have a state agreement that they can be deputized to travel to other agencies any where in the state to assist with any type of problems.  As far at training, you and Obama have no idea what kind of training agencies are required by state laws to put their officers through.  Many agencies have officers trained by DHS in case of terrorism.
n*<3>                        Bob,
n<117>                    We can't train.  Our budget is too diminished at this point.  The National Guard had to cancel TWO training months in August and September due to a budget shortfall and the lodging program has been canceled entirely.  Our Soldiers aren't even eating hot meals any longer, it's all MREs now because the food budget was slashed as well.
n*<1>                        No more hot meals? CNN had a Thanksgiving story about the troops in Afghanistan having a big turkey dinner with all the fixins. Looked good to me.
n*<2>                        maybe the army can get food stamps!
n*<3>                        Mobilized Soldiers still get hot meals, I'm talking about in the training environment specifically.
n<118>                    Oh hail to the great Obama Liar in Chief.  Without your leadership where would we be?  Thank you for saving us!  What a pathetic POTUS you are!!!!  This is a state issue and the only racism is the black community shouting out racism.  Just go back to your golf course and work on your lay up shot since you laid down on your job.  Just sit back and leave the office as fast as possible.  You should not be involved in this issue but since you hate America, hate Americans, and are a racist Muslim, I guess this was just too good for you to keep your mouth shut.  NOW, MR. PRESIDENT (cough, cough)- when are you going to speak out about the black boys who shot the Autralian Baseball Player, or the black thugs who beat up the white boy on the bus in Chicago, or the two black boys who killed the white tourists in Florida because "they done walked into the wrong neighborhood they white boys did".  Where are you for that our great pathetic leader?
n*<1>                        Hand gernades will diffuse a crowd
n*<2>                        I remember a speech Barack Hussein Obama II gave in 2008 Colorado before he was president and in it he said "We cannot continue to rely on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives that we've set. We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded."
n<119>                    On the eve of the Ferguson riot, Mr. Obama did not do anything to call for peace. 
n*<1>                        those thugs wouldn't listen to Obama, they shot 2 FBI agents
n*<2>                        Thats because they want this type of action by the people so they have a reason to take more of our bill of right away
n*<3>                        On the other hand, if Obama had called for peace, you'd be whining about that.
n*<4>                        God, where do you nutters come from.  You blame everything on the President.
n*<5>                        David you are one of a few that knows right from wrong you couldn't have said it any better
n*<6>                        Nice post Aaron
n*<7>                        let's not forget all this for a damn flag
n<120>                    Please do not be fooled by what you see on the TV. Most of these shootings are either set up in advance or seized upon and then manipulated. Disarming the American people includes our local police force. The elite new order does not want to move on their plans until we have been disarmed. Our local police force is a huge threat and that it why you are seeing the call to disarm. By the way this policeman used an ordinary hand gun and not a bazooka
n*<1>                        The problem was he used military tactics in a civilian job. Wilson is not judge, jury and executioner, and his job isn't to follow the rules of military engagement in a foreign land.
n*<2>                        Who knows what was in his head or the guy he shot who was just seen on tape intimidating and strong arm stealing only moments before. This comment is about the call to disarm our police force under false pretenses.  thinking the best bet would be to have a call to disarm Obama from his drones.
n*<3>                        big foot is real.  the moon landing is false. etc
n*<4>                        I don't know truly about either :)
n*<5>                        If your comment is about "the call to disarm our police force under false pretenses", why are you bothering to mention a completely irrelevant detail deliberately leaked by Ferguson PD to sway the minds of the ignorant? I'm thinking you must be some kind of a moron if you think your true point of view is being hidden.
n<121>                    Obama is just helping to keep the race war going. It's no secret that he and Michelle hate Whites. Look at his speech and comments he and Michelle have made over their years in the White House. As long as he is President we will have race hated. It's time for Jackson and Sharpton to get lost also. They are the worst White haters to ever live. They will have a lot to answer for when they get to the Pearly Gates, if they do get to go there. If they don't get in they will cry racism.
n<122>                    All of this based on the lie of Brown's partner in crime.  It's really a sad day when the (proven) lie from a criminal has caused hundreds of millions of dollars in destruction, countless lives ruined, and now EVERY police officer (white AND BLACK) will be handcuffed in their ability to protect themselves and those in the community that they have sworn to protect.  Liberal groups and the Liberal media should be ashamed for using this lie to further their agenda.
n*<1>                        How does wearing a body cam hinder a cop from doing his job? It protects the public from abusive cops, and it protects cops against false allegations.
n*<2>                        I'll have to agree with you, CWFMPT!  That little liar Johnson, should be found guilty for his lies.  But, the sad part is, he won't because he's black.
n<123>                    Just to help you understand I have never had a problem with a cop except one time and I have been in these type of situation so there is the facts on that. As a matter of fact the cop I had a problem with was fire after 3days. He was a bad cop. There are good cops big time but as always your going to have those who are going to not see the real facts because they have already chosen a side on what ever issue. As far as the brown situation goes he was wrong and got his just deserts I feel but for the 12 year old it was a bad call on the cops part. Its just to bad that those who determine what the cop did were also law enforcement as well. Should be law abiding civilians that make the call on matters like this not other law enforcement officials.
n<124>                    Many Republican reps including GOP heavy hitters Tom Coburn and Rand Paul are very, very much against police militarization. Just as ANY American citizen should be. We have a standing army- we don't need local ones with that kind of firepower. Ever heard of the phrase "overawe the public sentiment"? It was used by one of our most important founders with regards to this issue. Of course, I wouldn't expect any of you to care about history, context, or actual personal liberty.
n*<1>                        So what do you expect the police to use when criminals have military like weapons and full body armor? Or maybe we should give them squirt guns and then call in the Army when idiots riot and loot their own city because their angry.
n*<2>                        Please show me criminals with "military style weapons". I live in one of the most dangerous cities in the US and work with gang members. I can assure you that the police outgun them. Please stop watching so much television. They're called movies for a reason....
n<125>                    To Obama:  #$%$?  YOUR race is acting like a bunch of thugs, hetherns, and terrorists.  Of course, due to THEIR level of intelligence, we are going to engage the  military and their equipment.  Burning down houses, churches, business; looting; stealing; and lying are the signs STRONG action needs to be taken.  You are a WORTHLESS person, not to mention an incompetent "leader".  Leader is in quotes because you may have the title, but you don't have the common sense or basic skill set that one needs to be a leader.
n*<1>                        Watched Obama's speech today where he was patting himself on the back for programs he hopes to accomplish in the future.  Police sitting next to him had an expression on his face that said, "Liar, liar, pants on fire!"
n<126>                    This is an extreme over-reaction to something that should not be given this much attention.  Obama should simply tell his people to obey the laws like everyone else and you won't have to worry about being shot by a cop doing his job.  This is an effort to appease blacks.  If Brown had been white, this would not be an issue at all.  It's all about the blacks.  No other race is as violent when they don't get their way.  Society and Governmental agencies have made blacks so used to having what they want for fear of violence, that we now have to endure it.  Brown was wrong and caused his own death but no one cares about that.  Just give the blacks what they want and no one will get hurt.  Hmmm, sounds like a criminal talking, doesn't it?
n<127>                    Obama is a racist who ignores facts and distorts facts. He is the first president who ignores the rule of law in this country. Instead of blaming the thug Brown, he blames the officer. Yes, he is blaming the officer by focusing on the police rather than calling it for what it is. 93% of the murders in the black community are committed by other blacks. Why isn't he outraged by this? What he is doing is perpetuating the notion that police are the racists. All the evidence points to the fact that Brown was a strong armed robber that day and then attacked the officer. The facts show it. People who disregard this evidence are apologists for criminal behavior. They are trying to rewrite the evidence and history the way they want it rather than speak the truth. They want it to fit in their political agenda. If this is what we allow in America these days, this country of ours is going to fall apart.
n*<1>                        @George Rosko.....and 83% of the murders in the white community are committed by other whites..are YOU you outraged by that?
n<128>                    Will President Obama issue an executive order to require the training of "peaceful" protesters  to NOT burn down stores and loot? Will he issue an executive order to require the training young black men to respect the police instead of trying to kill them? Will he issue an executive order requiring the training young black men not to rob convenience stores? Will he issue an executive order requiring "civil rights" leaders like Al Sharpton to NOT constantly fan the flames of racial strife with their unfair rhetoric?
n*<1>                        Hopefully he will issue an order for you to shut up.
n*<2>                        He will do none of the above, and probably wants the fed overseeing the local police departments so they can use force against people who don't want rioting or looting.  Or they will be directed to go after whites only.  He's already proven to the world that he is racist, and supports the race of his father, who was absent in his childhood.
n<129>                    This was a real conundrum for Obama. At least with the Trayvon Martin case, the two people involved were both civilians. That made it easy for Obama  to side with the black youth, and make comments like, " If I had a son, he'd look just like Trayvon".  But the Brown case involved a black civilian and a white  police officer. The police officer is a public servant, and so is Obama, representing the same Constitution and the same country. So Obama said nothing. He never spoke to the Mayor of Ferguson, even to ask if there was something he could do to help. He never spoke to the Police Chief. He only spoke to Sharpton, and the other riot organizers, and told them to, "Keep pushing".
n*<1>                        Divisive really?
n*<2>                        Anthony are you really incredulous? We're talking about a President who cancelled the National Day of Prayer (an old American tradition). Then, during the Islamic month of Ramadan, Obama declared a National Day of Islamic Prayer. If that's not divisive, you let me know what is.
n*<3>                        A hundred thumbs up!  I've posted the following a number of times, but it deserves repeating: "During the 503 days between the Trayvon Martin shooting and the Zimmerman verdict 10,865 blacks were killed by other blacks.  Name One."
n*<4>                        White vs. Black happened in both these homicides.  When will every race trust each other. Isn't that Jesus Christ wanted on this Earth.
n*<5>                        Eddie, you're an idiot...you just don't get the big picture do you?
n*<6>                        Eddie: that's right. Prayer isn't as popular as it once was. But it DOES read, "In God we Trust" on your money, right?  (It doesn't say "In Allah we Trust").The founding Fathers were not Jihadists.  So why would Obama declare an ISLAMIC Day of Prayer after cancelling the Christian Day? Like Joker said, "Look at the Big Picture".
n*<7>                        Eddie: That's a scary statement, but I'm inclined to think that you're right about that. We're in deep you-know-what..
n<130>                    I heard he is bring in Charles Ramsey who is in charge of the Philadelphia Police Department.  He is the former chief in Washington DC when he Made a decision to arrest protestors and citizens that were not protesting in Pershing Park which led to a lawsuit that cost the city in excess of four million dollars.  He then had a white higher ranking official take the responsibility for the arrest and he was awarded by Ramsey with another promotion.  Ramsey was also on the Chicago Police Department and was friends with Holder when they both were in Washington DC.  Ramsey is not the person who should be reviewing police Departments throughout the country.
n*<1>                        After reviewing finalization on settlement for Pershing Park was Twenty Two Million dollars.  More than five times the original settlement.  Ramsey, no way!
n<131>                    I support the police all wearing cameras.  I read that when they did, accusations of police brutality reduced by over half. and it also reduced accusations of police racism, by showing what really happened.  I wish Wilson had worn one.  Then the racists thugs who lied about him and the racist thugs who march wanting him dead would have to shut up.  And the media plays up the "unarmed".  Why didn't they defend the teens who beat a black man to death not too long ago?  They were "unarmed".
n*<1>                                    the reason that he was "un-armed" was that he failed to disarm the big, bad,COP
n<132>                    The police have riot gear and guns. They don't need military grade weapons, especially since they don't use the weapons they are given for daily use. The biggest complaint I have about police in any city when faced with riots is that they don't shoot the rioters with bullets. The quickest way to make certain people protest instead of riot is to shoot to kill once or twice. The rioters don't fear the police because any real action would be reported as firing on unarmed peaceful protests -- journalists lie.
n<133>                    Police Officers are going to become more reluctant to utilize their force options in many situations. This will cause them to face severe injuries and potentially the loss of their lives. Will anyone mourn their life? Will their families be interviewed and profit from his death? Will people riot in the streets when the next police officer is killed by some gangbangin thug? Most likely not. People will continue to complain about police and then call them when they need help; only to mock them behind their backs.
n*<1>                        LOL
n*<2>                        Police need to tone down their us vs. them mentality.
n*<3>                        I'm positive you are speculating, so I will read it as such and disregard. A de-militarized police force has never shown the situations that you claim, that is, outside of a very few handfuls of rare occurrences. Police are a necessary evil and we don't need them to be soldiers.
n*<4>                        This is where you are wrong Bob, police should always be reluctant to utilize their force options. Force is a last resort - always.
n*<5>                        No one is calling for cops to be  mocked.  However time for some perspective.  last y ear less than 30 cops were killed in the line of duty country wide.  Most were in driving accidents.  Let's really look at the problem here.  We should be routing out bad officers.
n*<6>                        Maybe they should act like responsible citizens instead of like infallible "kings men".
n*<7>                        who cares no one told the to be pigs
n*<8>                        Right on! 
n*<9>                        Set up civilian jobs retraining programs for white police officers. Public donations would more than supply the needed funds. White police officers are not safe in many cities.
n*<10>                        Law enforcement is to protect &amp; serve the public!
n*<11>                        Why would the become more reluctant? There is no consequences brought on them.
n*<12>                        Maintaining the peace is far different than what military hardware provides for. A public servant in uniform is equipped to maintain the peace with the standard issue firearms and body armor that has existed prior to the federal government dumping military equipment into local police forces.
n<134>                    Just what we need you liberal jerk.  Maybe you can do it by executive order and bypass Congress.    We need less regulation not more.  The Federal Government should have thought of this a long time ago.  When this gear was provided to the Police someone should have used their brain and said "should I".  But no, now we get more regulation and $236 million in funds for Fergusaon, Mo.  Stay out of States rights because all you do is screw crap up and then raise our taxes to pay for it.
n<135>                    During the current fiscal year, DHS plans to award $1.6bn in grant money for state, local and tribal agencies, mostly to aid them with counterterrorism, border security and disaster preparedness, it announced last month. By contrast, the Defense Department¡¯s ¡°1033¡± program to transfer surplus military gear gave out less than $500m worth of equipment in fiscal 2013.
n<136>                    Okay, just have to put in my 2 cents worth.  This was not the police departments fault, even if it had been out and out murder, the hoodlums that went out of control burning , looting, raping, killing, and destroying all in the name of justice are 100 percent in the wrong and will not be punished for what THEY have done.  I say if you are a black city, then get rid of all law enforcement, fire departments, teachers and just do it your way.  Build a wall around your community and no one will go in and no one will go out.  Oh and all government assistance of any kind stops.  and last but not least no nasty National Guard will be sent in to help because we just don't want to offend or intimidate!
n*<1>                        i say capitol idea my dear
n*<2>                        The pohtesters are Obama's focus as well as notso Sharpton.
n*<3>                        great plan, segregation!
n*<4>                        I didn't hear about the killing and raping but the police arrested several hundred people and they will be fined or stand trial for their crimes.
n<137>                    Mike Brown¡¯s Mother Arrested For Armed Robbery, Faces Felonies [VIDEO] Recently, Mike Brown???s mother Lesley McSpadden is fighting the media after it was revealed that she lead a group that actually beat and robbed vendors selling ???Justice for Michael Brown??? T-Shirts. According to reports, McSpadden led the group in mid-October. One of the vendors was McSpadden???s former mother-in-law Pearlie Gordon, Michael Brown???s grandmother. She was hospitalized after being beaten with a pipe during the incident. Gordon claims that she was approached by McSpadden who yelled, ???You can???t sell this s**t!??? Still, Gordon argued that unless she ???could product documentation stating that she had a patent on her son???s name, she was going to continue to sell her merchandise.??? At the end of the struggle, $1,500 in merchandise and $400 in cash was stolen during the robbery. The case has been deemed ???felony armed robbery???, meaning that McSpadden could be facing serious jail time if convicted.
n*<1>                        @ GW, who gets a patent on her dead son's name? This story gets crazier by the moment. Thanks for the article.
n*<2>                        Mother like her son.  No wonder Mike Brown was the way he was with his mother being such a great example.
n*<3>                        YEAH IT;S OK WHEN THEY DO IT TO THEM SELFS AND  OTHERS,BUT NOT OK IF WE DO IT TO THEM
n<138>                    I think in cases like Brown's, the police should stay out of it. They aren't appreciated and God forbid they shoot someone. Their lives will be ruined. And MB's parents pushing for body cameras. I just wish officer Wilson has been wearing one and then maybe none of the grand jury foolishness would have been necessary. MB's parents want notoriety which will bring them money. That's all. They are in the same class as Al and Jesse. Just show me the money.She should be in jail. Unfortunately no one was wearing a body camera when she and thugs beat up relatives for selling MB t-shirts, huh?
n*<1>                        Its called trust and something that is going terribly away...people have always lied but before we had integrity. But when people lie to destroy your integrity, that too will go away and then whats left? Body cameras?....I'm glad I was raised in a different time....I don't like these times....or these people....
n*<2>                        Cameras wont matter, if it supports the officers side of the story they will say the video was tampered with, or completely ignore it as they did with the evidence which proved officer Wilsons account.
n*<3>                        They all saw the video of Michael Brown stealing &amp; assaulting a much smaller, elderly store clerk before he attacked officer Wilson -they didn't seem to care.
n*<4>                        Brown family IGNORED convenience store video of their son robbing the store.
n*<5>                        yeah. having cameras will not  make a difference as far as what these "protesters" will believe, but it would make them all look like total idiots.  Although in this case, here store robbery video still didn't stop them or the celebrities/football players.  At least THE ENTIRE US now knows how stupid and unreasonable Sharpton and his homeboys are , and will NEVER again take them seriously. Blacks' fight for equality lost ALL credence.
n<139>                    Cops, state militia, and some Feds were all around that area in Ferguson, out of sight and ordered to stand down by the Mayor as I read it. How can they fight terrorism as was seen that week when the ones in charge are so afraid of political correctness that they are impotent. I like to watch all the law enforcement people running around in their genuine Army issue fighting equipment. Kind of makes one wonder how they ever fought crime before Kevlar, drop-down holsters, and helmets. Now some towns have armored carriers, tanks, and all the goodies. Holy moly, it's Robocops.
n*<1>                        What I have read and seen on TV it wasn't the mayor who called them off, but the Governor.  In fact the mayor was trying to get a hold of the Governor all night to come in and help the police.  There is speculation that the Obama Administration told the Governor to back off.
n*<2>                        The Guard was deployed in St. Louis instead of Ferguson by the Governor.  Politics was involved, the Governor is a Democrat and it is believed that Obama and Eric Holder was pulling the strings.
n*<3>                        CARenegade..."believed that Obama and Holder was pulling the strings"?  You can bet your last dollar they were!
n<140>                    So the problem wasn't the large mob that showed up and started looting and burning buildings down , it was the police that showed up in protective gear.  I see now if the police just hadn't responded at all none of this looting and burning would have happened.  Typical Obama logic.  I'm all for more training no matter what the job is.  But not outfitting these guns with gear to protect themselves is insane.  30 police against hundreds of rioters and the cops should be armed with what bullhorns pleading for calm?  What do you think would have happened if armed police didn't show up.  This town wouldn't even be on the map anymore.  
n<141>                    Police or police tactics clearly are not the problem here. Thugs that fail to comply with police orders and attack officers are the problem. Rioting thugs who burn buildings,cars and murder witness' are the problem. Glorifying thug life and excusing criminal behavior is the problem. Using their anger at the grand jury's decision as a excuse and reason to destroy Ferguson is the problem. A President and AG who take sides all the while pretending to be impartial is part of the  problem as well. A president who values the opinion of Sharpton and Jackson is a problem. Oversight.. from this administration LOL .
n<142>                    What training do they need they are trained Law Enforcement officers 65% or more are former Military...And they didn't fire Cannons Missiles Machine Guns or use RPG's or hand grenades during the Peaceful Protests I don't believe they ever fired any thing except tear gas ... They were how ever armed with tactical rifles teargas and bullet proof body armor and were using armored tactical Vehicles THERE WAS NO USE OF MILITARY TYPE OR STYLE FORCE...Mr Obama needs to shove AG Holder off the roof of the White House and then sit on an egg...
n<143>                    Citizens will continue to denounce Obama's policies and Democrats' ridiculous campaigns:
n<144>                    If you only read one comment, read this one. It's long but it's worth it, money back guarantee.

n*<3>                        Do the world a favor and keep reproducing your self so
n<145>                    I have a wonderful idea.
n<146>                    He is doing it precisely by the book, the book of Socialism, and it¡¯s a classic socialism; first imposing new restrictions on police depts. taking their authorized tools (guns, etc.) away following up by nationalism policy.  People, what we see here is total power grab by the POTUS and no resistance whatsoever. Al Sharpton (a criminal) along and Commie Eric Holder are his friends and confidants. You who voted for this fraud of a Pres are you happy now? This is what you get when putting in office a person we knew nothing about. A community agitator running a country our forefathers had died to build for us. A beautiful land, the most just country in a world with a superb Judeo-Christian heritage being peed on by a stranger living in our house, the White House.
n<147>                    There is always training after incidents that involve police shooting an individual. The police department I am sure  has already begun thinking about ways this incident could be avoided or at least diffused in the future. It is never there mission to have to shoot anyone. Or for that matter arrest anyone. They would much rather everyone just obey the law but sadly that will never happen so they are forced to go out there and put their lives on the line to keep those individuals who refuse to play within the rules in check. I don't want to know where we would be if it not for our police force so I am very thankful to have them and I fully support them and all their effort.They are angels looking out for all of us no matter what economic background, color or race we are.
n*<1>                        They already know how to prevent this from Happening again.... Put every single black Gang banger in America in prison.
n<148>                    What Obama and the government should address is HOW these police departments are able to get their other high priced equipment and weaponry.
n<149>                    MORE TRAINING??? NO teach these young black men that if they resort to violence and are agressive they will most likely be shot for their actions. Where are the photos or videos of this man Michael Brown holding up his arms and giving up? Right; there are none or you would have seen them all over the place. You have a bunch of "EYE" witnesses who say they saw this? Come on Man they all had camera phones I want to see the proof that this guy had his hands up and not on the trigger guard, as he tried to take the officers service weapon away from him. It is NOT a black and white thing, it is a criminal continuing to be a criminal when stopped by the law. No respect for the law or fellow citizens as was demostrated in the store!
n*<1>                        All the witness' lied.
n*<2>                        I agree with you and most of these statement on this matter. I also think that the families need to teach their kids RESPECT!!! This is 2014, not 1914 get over the black #$%$. I am Mexican, American Indian and White, you dont see me or my family acting a fool!!!! Ohh wait I just retired from serving in the US Army (Infantry) for 20 years too.
n<150>                    I have never been to Russia but here in the US we always here that Russia and China are both police states. The police supposedly run and control everything. But with that said, I have been to China many times, first time when I was in recovery for cancer. My brother went with me on that trip and both of us agreed everything we had ever been told, had read or thought was wrong about China. The US is the POLICE state compared to China. In China I never had a fear of the Chinese police, the locals never feared the Chinese police. The Chinese police did not carry guns, tazers, any kind of shock sticks nor any kind of spray gas. I met a Chinese lady there in 2007 and today we are married. I have eat and drunk much liquor with police in China and there is no feeling of superiority from them as the police here in the US have. The police in China help you with tazis and getting around in areas you know nothing of. I am almost 65 and have lived in the US all my life. I do KNOW how the law is used and abused here now and for the past 50 years or so. As Americans we HAVE to do something about our country or we will become the devil we preached about for the past 50 years.

n<151>                    It is sad to see so many people doing all of this, in the name of a lie, told by someone that was there, yet, he lied to all, because he is black, and that makes it alright to all the blacks in the town, yet over a lie, what a shame it is, now the president wants in on this, guess he wants his name in the mix, it is sad to watch all of this, over a lie, just can't get it????
n<152>                    I have never seen so many ignorant posts in my whole life.  Anyone who has traveled as much as I have knows you don't want the military and the police to be the same.  That is a very dangerous situation.  I also see an attempt, mostly successful to block peaceful protest in our country.  This is also a dangerous situation and is protected by our constitution.  Due to the Patriot Act we are losing our rights.  I wish I saw more people screaming about that.
n<153>                    Is this what came out of the high level meetings at the white house? That's right Mr. President, take away whatever is needed to combat rioting in the streets. It's absurd that we might need the military or miitary like weapons...after all it's just a few kids having fun trying to make a statement. We wouldn't want another meaningless killing. Let's just let the kids tire themselves out like kids do. After all, how long can they go on? 
n<154>                    The use of military equipment is a way of subduing the masses. It's all part of causing desention and division. The real facts are this guy was a common criminal. If the store worker shot him everything would be silent.His parents wouldn't have a chance of more lawsuits..The pres. only cares about immigration for more voters.Think of all the jobs young blacks are losing because of it ..Sharpton and J. Jackson exploit thes trageties for their political benefit and offer nothing to the black communities to advance them
n<155>                    I think body camera are a great idea, unfortunately I think they are going to benefit police officers more than citizens.  The police will be constantly aware that they are on, unruly, law-breaking, assaulting insects will not be.  The cameras are going to put an end to cops being unfairly accused of wrong-doing by thugs and others who think they should be able to do whatever whenever simply because they are black!  Bring it on!!  I think it is interesting that we aren't hearing more support of body cameras on police from the black communities - you would think that they would think it is the greatest thing in the world???  But of course they probably also realize that what it really means is that like in 98% of incidences like Ferguson where it is "he said, she said" the cameras are going to show black law-breakers in the wrong and not the police!  Whoopsie, interesting turn of perspective isn't it!!!!
n*<1>                        Absolutely true. It'll keep the cops honest but, mostly, it will disprove all the lies told by these violent career criminals, and their enablers.
n*<2>                        I Totally Agree
n*<3>                        Places they have tried giving police body cameras have seen complaints against the police drop by around 70%.  Apparently just knowing that the cameras are on keeps the police in line.  But yes, it is also for the protection of the police from made up accusations and exaggerations.  There really is no rational argument against it beyond the general cost.  And given how much we already spend on police, this is just a minor cost that will help everyone involved by making rulings about interactions with police become based on actual evidence.
n*<4>                        I think I hear a lot of support for the body camera in the black community. There are whole organizations dedicated to it. Just google it. As a white male with no criminal history, I would feel more comfortable if any future dealings with the police were recorded.
n*<5>                        You mentioned black three times in your narrative.
n*<6>                        What a stupid comment.  
n*<7>                        Black communities have been calling for cameras for a long time!!! It is one of the subjects discussed in the Fergusson protests. lol In depts. that use them now, police complaints have dropped 80%. Wire them all and make citizen oversight committees and every complaint goes in front of committee with video.
n*<8>                        TeaTrollPatrol: That's just exactly why the huge "racism" argument about Ferguson is just a lot of hooey.  A lot of blacks assume that whites don't get treated poorly by cops, as part of "white privilege." Nonsense.  Probably the biggest deterrent keeping me from choosing crime in my teen years was the certain knowledge/belief that I would probably be brutalized by cops and prison guards.
n*<9>                        Absolutely crazy that trying to do their job, all law enforcement officials will have to be video wired at all times. We also know that in any occupation you are dealing with other frail human beings that are not always perfect. Anyone with a lick of sense also knows, that for this reason bad lemons turn up in police uniforms and tailor-made suits and religious garb. I venture to say this however. Put body cameras on all police officials and considering what we have in the general public today, I don?t think much will change. That is, unless this rioting, lotting and other classes from petty to grand larceny and killing, start changing. Of course we could go one step farther and take away arms from law enforcement to pacify the lawless class. With the video cameras, and no guns, an every increasing number of dead policemen would have a undisputed record of how they met their fate. At this point there will not be many volunteers for law enforcement and we may need something else. An Executive order or better yet, Congressional legislation to start a procedure of drafting recruits to fill the needed slots. How does that sound on a non discrimination basis as to color, creed or religion?
n*<10>                        @big duff, I do not follow your comment. It makes so little sense. How would recording and holding people accountable, both police and citizenry, not change anything. In states where this is common practice, the number of complaints by police and citizens dropped by 70%. That's actually a lot of change. Police are public servants, if they do their job well, then there is nothing to be afraid of by recording it.
n<156>                    "New York Times reporters Julie Bosman and Campbell Robertson published the address of Darren Wilson in the New York Times.
n*<1>                        These reporters really put Wilson in danger! How Stupid they are! Pray for Wilson!
n*<2>                        The media puts everyone in danger with their biased reports and lies
n*<3>                        Good for you!
n*<4>                        keep the media away and most of the problems will go away. as soon as people see a camera, they go nuts. cops need all this gear cause they fear for their lives. I can see where this going. it was cold, they shoulda used water cannons. read today where more blacks should be able to open carry, wonder what that would lead to.
n*<5>                        Gee! Why don't Julie Bosman and Campbell Robertson report the names and address's of the racist who made death threats to Wilson?
n*<6>                        Her phone is off and voice mail box is full! How ironic....
n<157>                    civil libertarian's want more combat gear for police Dept.]s
n<158>                    Truth, 150 years ago in this country it was the white man that fought, killed, died and suffered to free the black man. Then as is now, the back man did little to nothing to help himself nor did he help those that were helping him and so he is now ignorant of the concept of responsibility and sacrifice and has no need for education, motivation or to better themselves. With 150 years of freedom behind them, the American black man seems unable to understand the simple logic of reality that freedom is not free and self-pity is not entitled.
n*<1>                        Your such an idiot.  Thousands of Black Americans have fought and died for this country.  Black Americans have served in uniform and theyve done more for this nation than you ever have.  Your a Punk.
n*<2>                        Michael, it's "you're" not "your."
n*<3>                        Haha, yes, we white people who kidnapped Africans, brought them here against their will, forced them to work for us for generations with no pay and no freedom are owed gratitude from black people for eventually freeing them?
n*<4>                        Boomers, why dont you focus more on the fact that  NS is insulting thousands upon thousands of Military Servicemen/women, past/present instead??
n*<5>                        They fought for our Freedom and Liberty, and NS here  insult's them by insinuating they arent responsible Americans.  How  disrespectful is that?
n<159>                    "Local officers showed up to control protests sparked by the fatal police shooting of unarmed teen Michael Brown in armored tank-like vehicles, wearing military-style riot gear, and holding assault weapons."
n<160>                    Something was lacking, for sure.  The National Guard was called out.  The local police was provided protective gear, and cars were burned anyway.  Businesses were destroyed anyway.  Something was lacking.  Maybe there are too many restrictions on what the Enforcers are allowed to do.  Good grief!  How much cumbersome stuff does a law enforcement person have to carry to have an alibi for himself.
n<161>                    It begins with the vetting of police cadets. Police departments try to weed out the egos that create this kind of backlash, but all to often, the egos slip through because this type of personality are the first to apply for law enforcement. Some slip by.
n<162>                    So here's the thing about body cameras... To be effective they need to be always on.  So then police can simply "walk the beat" and gather up data about who goes where and does what in the community.  How long can they keep this data?  Days, months, years?   Between cell phone data, liscence plate info and body camera footage the local police department will be able to pretty much track anyone they want.  
n<163>                    There is a big line of difference by having a protest march, or burning down a community and its property. There is a big difference between being able to recognize decisions made by Justice or not being able to recognize them neither accept them.
n<164>                    Hey Prez.    Any hedging on your part encourages bad community behavior.  I guess you feel the need to support the "Burn this bitc(h) down! stepfather.    May I remind you that you are the Chief Executive Officer.    These federal programs that give out military gear to local policemen?    That is under your watch.   Personally I approve of the police showing up  fit and prepared to handle rioters, looters, and arsonists.    If the blacks don't like it then ask them not to provoke the police response.    Stay home.   Have them phone in their complaints to their representatives.    Give them your personal email address.   But you, Mr President, have to be seen as upholding all the laws of the United States.
n<165>                    It's fine for police to HAVE this equipment, it's the policies regarding WHEN and HOW they use it that needs serious review.
n*<1>                        Numerous times its been mentioned that police are more armed for that protest than for the middle east. They're not nearly as trained. If they have the equipment, more training should be required. As a soldier had said, "you want to play toy soldier as a cop, join the military". Should police be defenseless, No.
n*<2>                        seems about right.  but there are deeper historical trends about the use of law enforcement for social control.
n*<3>                        ttyler; the vast majority of police are prior military, so obviously they have the training on how to use the stuff.  it's the application policies of the department that are overzealous.
n*<4>                        Having police out in military gear to intimidate peaceful protests for food or fair wages feels like we are living in pre WWII Germany. We have the national guard for when the blank hits the fan, like in Ferguson. Let them drive the tanks and wear the military gear. 
n*<5>                        oOo. Did you see the article yahoo had about university "police" having access to the military equipment? Let me guess, the campus police is ex-military too?
n*<6>                        Yes it does need serious review! I'm not sure I would agree the local police need to have these weapons, vehicles and combat clothing. That gear should be left to the Nation Guard troops of each state. Local police are NOT meant to be (nor ever should be) a militarized force.
n<166>                    What makes me so angry in all of this. Not Obama, Jackson, Sharpton or even the media. Ever dare attest to the fact that all these ¡°protestors¡± and I use that term loosely¡­  is that all we hear is about injustice and anger and all that. Not a single entity has addressed the fact that all this ¡°protesting¡± isn¡¯t that at all. They are all criminal acts. And blacks wonder why more and more of America doesnt give a flying rip about anything with them. We would all sooner see you disappear period. You are useless. Worthless people.. you show over and over to the world. Why we don¡¯t like you to begin with. The people who are doing the ¡°protesting¡± don¡¯t give a rats butt about Brown.. Trayvon martin. Or anyone else. They simply see these opportunities as chances to redecorate their ¡°cribs¡±.. its so freaking pathetic..  and the saddest part is. They are never called out for what they do.. its just oh those poor blacks. Look at how we treat them.. give me a freaking break.. you all can go to hell for all I care. You are not worth the air you breath..
n*<1>                        Ill be the first to thumbs down you, for lumping all people into one ball of hate.
n<167>                    How dishonest it is to pretend this has anything to do with what gear the police have...they have been upgrading gear to keep up with criminals since the Bank Robbery shootout in the 90's where cops were sadly outgunned. BUT SURE lets pretend that old military vehicles cause criminals to act like...criminals. How about instead of giving the cops that old MRAP, sell it to pay for cameras on every officer. We desperatly need cameras to combat the dishonest narrative the follows every officer involved shooting (from both sides of the issue). But instead our would be emperor gets to work on more bureaucracy...and we all need more of that in our lives....wow.
n*<1>                        moron...we don't base out entire law enforcement policy based on ONE incident that was well planned...If the police had the equipment at that bank shootout, the bank robbers would have brought more with them.....they only brought what they needed to fend off the cops...its not too much different than computer viruses....if the cops set up a certain procedure, others will adapt and work around that procedure....
n*<2>                        Oh good, another child that cant have a decent discussion on these comment threads. And MORON...if you paid attention, that one single shootout caused a change in policy for departments across the U.S., Its called learning from other depts experiences....kinda the way they study dash cam footage from multiple depts. Some depts take a more proactive approach, despite how many choose to be reactive.
n*<3>                        Loki, that is exactly what happened. Those two guys outgunned the cops, it was no contest. You can see them in action on you tube, just look for the North Hollywood Shootout. As far as criminals go they were a class act.
n<168>                    the fed was RIGHT to have local enorcement have these military vehicles 
n<169>                    Well, he wants to train the police force.  Did not see anything about telling people to stop committing crimes or you will suffer the consequences no matter what color you are.  I don't really know why any one would want to be in law enforcement anymore, putting their lives in danger and not even being backed by this so called President of the United States.  I want a camera tracking Obama's every move--WAIT--I do not.  Sick of seeing this guy all of the time on news broadcasts and internet postings and how many times has he interrupted prime time TV???  What is the world is happening to the United States under this administration?
n<170>                    Local police do NOT need to have these weapons, vehicles and combat clothing. That gear should be left to the Nation Guard troops of each state. Local police are NOT meant to be (nor ever should be) a militarized force.
n<171>                    It's a tragedy that this young man died.  All to often the race card is applied to situation and if one dares to say anything they are labeled a racist.  From the President on down only soft discussions are heard at realistically curbing the violence and talking about the core problems with solutions to the problem.
n<172>                    I wonder if anyone at the White House saw the Police Cars Burning on television? Duh, apparently they were not aggressive enough to stop that? Maybe the cops need somewhere to hide from the rocks and bottles and molotov cocktails? Ya think? I mean, they are the cops and that is their job right? They are supposed to arrest the bad guys right? How many got arrested? How many got wounded? How many more will get arrested? How many more will get wounded? Will the Police shoot anymore people? NO! Pull the cops out and let the ,you know,do what they want. Pull out the cops and leave the media.
n<173>                    Of course.... pass out the military gear freely at first, so there doesn't appear to be any ill intentions involved. Then, create a disaster (Ferguson) to give you an excuse to use it. Then, when the public starts having second thoughts about the newly created militarized police force, the ignorant public will beg the government to come give the police "training" on how to use their new gear. Once again the ignorant public is easily duped, and the government succeeded in militarizing our police force right before our very eyes. Most are so dumb they will probably applaud the government for giving our oppressors the extra training they need.
n*<1>                        Martial law is just a stones throw away at anytime in this country and now it is a mear pebble toss away.
n<174>                    Thugs do not like the police being able to stop them.  Holder sold all these automatic weapons to drug cartels and now he wants to disarm our police.  This make sense to you?  Remember LA shoot out or Columbine?  These tragedies are why there was a call to better arm our police.  Now America has become a felon friendly environment and now police need unarmed along with the law abiding citizens.  Brown was a felon and the report that he had his hands up has been proven to be false by many witnesses, and testimony of those saying his hands were up has been proven to be lies.
n<175>                    Obama should be stepping back from this instead of making it worse. The same goes with the media. All it does is instigates people to do stupid things and get their 15 minutes of fame. This has so totally gotten out of hand. Don't blame the police...they did their job when they were allowed to. How about holding the rioters, those that caused so much heartache for the entire town...he doesn't hold them accountable. 10 years ago we would have.
n<176>                    I think it was in 1979 or so where around there where the congress and senate stated that the cops were not there to serve and protect us they are there to make sure the system that is in place is protected. Meaning government officials buildings and the COG system. When I did the research on this then in understood the militarization of the police forces across the country. Check it out this is a fact. Now we do have cops that take their jobs seriously and follow all procedures but not all now. I couldn't believe what I was told and read directly for those at the top. Crazy we are told one thing and shown another when it comes to law enforcement
n*<1>                        Police and Sheriffs are local. Why would congress and the Senate, which are  Federal be talking about the responsibilities of local police? Different localities have different expectations of their local law enforcement. Different localities have different issues that face them as well.
n<177>                    Every action by Obama and his people indicate to the black community that they are correct in their conclusions that all policemen (white) have an unspoken desire to kill black people.  The Brown family refuses to admit that their son was in the wrong.  With Sharpton acting as the Obama's spokesperson to say the things that, as president, he is unable to say while he is in office, the bigotry and racism tantamount to the Presidents mindset is crystal clear to the multitude of black people and is the justification for their atrocious behavior around the country.
n<178>                    Once again the Federal Government i.e. Obama is interfering where they don't belong. I'd bet it's a violation of our constitution and state/local laws for them to control local police. But we won't see any opposition to this because it's being done using the disguise of racism by the police. 
n<179>                    Has anyone noticed that NO Democrat or Republican will talk about this, or anything to do with Ferguson. Only the President.They are terrified of the political ramifications. But Ferguson is not the only place in America this happens, Thugs kill cops, cops kill thugs, white cops do wrong, black cops do wrong. This was simply a reporters dream at the time, without unrest we wouldn't need cops or military or governments, its a MACHINE...and must be fed lives to survive. It WILL continue. There is nothing to stop it, too many wheels turning.
n*<1>                        The Arms Merchants that are embedded with the Police Unions, Prison Unions, Local And County Police, Drug Testing Companies, Uniform suppliers will fight any move to remove the Military Hardware from distribution to local Police. The Supreme Court has labeled all criminals in this country as a potential Terrorist, or a Drug Kingpin, so now police can act as if they are at war with the citizens  in this country. Beware of the Police, they can shoot you and get away with murder, and hide behind their badge.
n<180>                    Military gear?
n*<1>                        B&amp;B is a great store. Bet their stores were packed for Black Friday.
n<181>                    Wake up do you really think all these continued protest are about getting cameras on the police there's always more to meet the eye ,dumb down the police let them walk on egg shells to appease the blacks,so when a real crises happens that effects everyone the police might decide not to act for fear of doing something to piss you off,or get sued,Will we end up with cops ignoring their job taking it with a "Oh Well Attitude" Obama, Holder, Sharpton need to mind their own business, i feel they are opening a new can of worms Take a look at  the illegals,blacks Muslims etc who cried the racist card the cops told to back off ,Soon all they will be policing are the whites and their self's..
n<182>                    Total disgrace! The people who are rioting, acting like animal and insist that it was a racial issue.  Get over it and act like normal people.  There are many other people who were shot by a police officer and the person who was shot was white.  It always seems to be the black people who act out of control when it come to a black person getting shot.  Our president Mr. B. Obama had my support until he put his nose into this problem that is not his problem, now that looks racist to me.
n<183>                    There's some bad cops all over the States but the majority do an honest job,it's the CRIMINALS  Barak should be telling to obey the law ,when like Brown  he breaks the law tries to take out the cop WHO WAS DEFENDING HIMSELF  . The Officer was proven innocent and Brown is dead because he refused to obey the law. Case closed.Obama and his corrupt racist gang should be made pay up to get the town fixed up and how about making a plea for the so called Brown supporters return what they stole from decent working people and destroying the town
n*<1>                        The officer was not proven innocent?! Where do you get this info? He never went to trial to be proven anything
n*<2>                        Obama did tell them to remain peaceful before the verdict. You are only spreading ignorance and hate.
n<184>                    Obama proves once again what a dumb a-- he is. Michael Brown is responsible for his death, not police, I have heard "shooter's bias" which is ridiculous. These black morons don't give a sh-- about the forensic evidence or the witness testimony. You never hear see them in Chicago where blacks are killed by other blacks every day. If Michael Brown would not have robbed a store the police would have not been looking for him. Does anyone disagree with this? If Michael Brown would have complied with the officer's instructions he would have been arrested but not killed. Does anyone disagree with this? Michael Brown tried to get the officers gun. Witness testimony and forensic evidence back this up. He charged the officer. Witness testimony and blood evidence prove that to be correct. He left a blood trail both going away and then coming back towards the officer. These are FACTS.Another fact is that if you live like a thug  chances are you will die like a thug.Teach your kids not to rob stores. Teach them to not try to go for a police officers gun. Teach your kids to comply with law enforcement.It's really pretty simple. I am sick of these race baiting low lifes making this out to be something it's not. GET REAL YOU STUPID BLACK MORONS.
n<185>                    "The executive order will direct agencies that distribute military-style equipment to local police to require training for cops that receive the gear."
n<186>                    I wish every single protester would spend one night making traffic stops or confronting armed assailants and thieves. Pull over a speeding or weaving car and walk up to tinted window at 3 AM. Otherwise, don't call on them when you hear a window breaking downstairs in middle of the night. Shooting a gun out of one's hand or a diabling shot to an arm or knee is something you see in the movies- they are trained to fire at mass in an instant if they are threatened, and rightfully so. There are injustices out there, and maybe the cameras will reduce them, but Michael Brown asked for it.
n<187>                    I am black and I have NO problem with Police having MILITARY weapons!!!
n<188>                    Of course Obama wants all of his police and military to know how to properly use these weapons, thus train them all. It just brings us one step closer to a communist run dictatorship. Your tax dollars are being spent for things that were never meant to be. Who do you think is paying for the maintenance on all those armored vehicles and weapons? What will the police say they need next? Nerve Gas? Flame throwers? Land Mines? Where does it end? It seems that we have no one in congress anymore with the backbone to challenge these rulings. All hail the King!
n<189>                    What an azzhole our president is. Michael Brown's father is videotaped saying "Burn the bit%% down" and isn't arrested for "inciting to riot", "inciting mayhem" or even disorderly conduct. So instead of going after the "protestors, aka criminals" and making them responsible for their actions, he's basically blaming the police for their proper response. 
n*<1>                        Robert: Well said
n*<2>                        Agree, why should we worry about ISIS
n*<3>                        whine whine whine people are never satisfied how bout we impeach you from free speech ? lol
n<190>                    More far left b.s and doctrine from His Highness. He knows nothing about policing and really doesn't care as long as he pleases "his people" and the likes of Al Sharpton. Federal law enforcement depends very heavily on state and local law enforcement. Obama and Holder are doing all they can to undermine that relationship and perhaps destroy it. The citizenry suffers as a result and that includes the black citizenry. The use of body cameras might well benefit the police more than the criminal. Had Officer Wilson been wearing one, neither the Brown family, Sharpton nor anyone else would have a legitimate ax to grind.
n<191>                    I would rather have POLITICIANS wear body-worn cameras. Politicians are in need of transaprency. This would also prevent EXCESSIVE use of taxpayer money and probably save more lives. The Browns need to face the fact that their son was a thug and move on. Funny how white people die everyday but it takes a black thug to get the presidents attention. So much so that the president sent White House aids to this thugs funeral. What kind of message does that send?
n<192>                    It's a sad day when the President of this Country seeks to bring our Police and their ability to enforce laws down to the level of the criminals out there. I for one am very glad that Police are armed and well trained on how to take control of potential violent crime situations. It's absolutely ludicrous to think the criminals at large are going to lesson their arsenal and choice of weapons. Our police forces should have available to them every legal means necessary to keep the peace by superior firepower if needed. The only statement our President should have made about Ferguson and the Police Department there should have been directed at the trouble makers, law breakers, looters, and violent protestors by making it clear that this type of behavior would not be acceptable or tollerated. he should have been clear about saying directly to these hoodlums in hoodies that the National Guard and Ferguson Pokice would respond as necessary to maintain order and protect the area. That's what a real President and a real Governor for that matter would have been saying on TV before the rioting even got started!
n<193>                    It sucks that the most important piece of this article is buried at the bottom, but at least it's there.
n*<1>                                    Body cameras wouldn't have changed a thing. The rioters dismissed all evidence counter to their 'Gentle Giant' narrative, what makes you think they wouldn't have ignored any video evidence from a body camera?
n<194>                    I've said this years ago. And I'll say it again. The police...local...county and state. Should have  better weapons then the general public. I also disapprove of large swat teams. But they are needed. But not with tanks, armored pers. carriers etc.. The country is all back-azzward. Gun violence should be treated as a federal offense. Anyone who is not allowed to own a gun. And is caught with one. Even if that means he's in a house/home that has a gun. Should be put away for 25 years minium. Gang members should be executed. They are in fact terrorists. One of the problems with these types of suggestion(s)..... is. The lawyers. Mosy of which are bleeding heart liberals. And are so far left. They walk in circules.
n<195>                    A nation can survive its fools, and even the ambitious. But it cannot survive treason from within. An enemy at the gates is less formidable, for he is known and carries his banner openly. But the traitor moves amongst those within the gate freely, his sly whispers rustling through all the alleys, heard in the very halls of government itself. For the traitor appears not a traitor; he speaks in accents familiar to his victims, and he wears their face and their arguments, he appeals to the baseness that lies deep in the hearts of all men. He rots the soul of a nation, he works secretly and unknown in the night to undermine the pillars of the city, he infects the body politic so that it can no longer resist. A murderer is less to fear.¡± By: Marcus Tullius Cicero
n<196>                    How about more guidance and oversight of America's troubled young black men?
n*<1>                        How about more oversight for the troubled white women of America? You know the over 110 million out of a 260 white American population, who are presently on welfare. 
n*<2>                        I have no idea what the hell you are talking about John. Sorry bud.
n<197>                    It's funny, I live here in Idaho where we can count the black people on one hand.  Then we have the Mexicans who almost number us.  I don't care for either of them but lets be honest here in our jails and prisons it is almost all white.  The welfare system is white because of the farmers.  Most of the drug use is by whites.  The people here--my people live just like the black's, Mexicans and Indians on the reservation.  We just need some one to blame and the colored people are it.  Hell look at the Russian Mob or the Mexican Cartels.  I tell you what will happen in the future cops will start to shoot us and then laws will change.  Think about it for a moment had the cop been black and the kid white----yes there would still be race war's going on as we speak.  And the cop would be in jail for murder. Admit it is true.  Some jack #$%$ would say his skin is to dark to see bruises so it was murder.  As far as the President goes do some home work he has done less Executive Privilege than the last one.  It would not matter how good of a job he has or has not done we would degrade it because we can't take a chance on another on of his kind getting into office.  This is america NO President has any power only the jack#$%$es  we vote into office as Senators or Congressmen.  As a retired Military Person we had a saying respect the uniform if you can't respect the man.  The President is called Mr. President, Sir, or something along those lines.  But not Obama.  Watch the next President I bet you your heart still beating as it is being ripped from your chest that the senate and congress screw with him or her just the same.
n<198>                    Stay The Course
n<199>                    There are lots of things that people do in protest other than what's going on right now. Way to much of the time peaceful protests are met with brutal force. Our police don't need to have military assault vehicles and equipment for this. 
n<200>                    as a middle aged white female I've been pulled a few times for speeding...I'll call that profiling because they can tell by my car/attire I have a job and the time of day is usually on my way to the job...therefore profiling, knowing I'm gonna pay that ticket, should we middle aged white females go raise hell and destroy the city, that isn't going to help my cause...I've learned to go under 40 mph in a 35 mph zone...guess what, obeying the law has proven not being pulled over in the last year...
n*<1>                        You go girl!
