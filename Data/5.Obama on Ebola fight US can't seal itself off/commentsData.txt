s<52>                        You are a daily diarrhea DW nameHacker 24/7 Yahoo TROLL aka JB, Sydney, Toby, Philip, Bob, steve, Johnson, Richard, Joey P, Ken, Colin, Frank, Tim etc... You are nothing without your phony accounts brigade FOOL... Did you ever GET the difference between “Whitewater Investigation” and “Watergate scandal”?... GET HELP... GET A LIFE... You DumbFK HAHAHA
s<97>                        Simply put, Sam, Ms. all Hickox has to do is stop ranting she is Ebola-free and prove it.  End of story.
s<101>                        Douglas-she just said in an interview that she won't self-quarantine.
s<110>                        why is he still president
s<117>                        You know what rally gets me is the cowards that will click a thumbs down but not post a reply, to voice their argument.
s<128>                        grow up aszclown
n<144>                        Mike, our Government and medical professionals have confused the issue so much that we won't know whether it's a pandemic until a few thousand Americans are hospital bound. Prevention is only as effective as the contingency plan that mitigates the threat. If none exists due to hyperbole and poor planning there is nothing you or I can do to prevent it's outbreak.
s<169>                        you must be a guvmunt troll,...
s<182>                        ..and more tax cuts for the rich.
s<202>                        yahoo ruins everything, that should say [K],K],K.
s<238>                        I guess that's what Faux told you. I was referring to total vacation time, not just golf. Do your research, which you will never find on Faux. Faux will tell you that Obama is worse in every category there is than anyone else and everything is his fault. The rest of the world looks at you with amazement at your ignorance, like, there's millions of people in this country and you blame everything on one person. Palinized.
n<309>                        that means nothing they can not prove they will not be contagious or exactly when they will be if they do have the disease
s<329>                        pssssst... pull your head out of your liberal #$%$.
n<368>                    Despite all of Obummer (the windbag's) latest useless mumbo-jumbo tongue wagging waste of our precious air, we have heard from the REAL military generals and they are going to quarantine their troops for 21 days to protect us from Ebola on their part. It's too bad, your Prez doesn't wake up and get his head out of his *@*s*s* JUST FOR ONCE in his miserable lifetime!
s<372>                        I'm with you loren. And we can add joea and kim to the park.....They are the reason why Republicans can't win the White House....They are about as uneducated a group of people you will fine anywhere.
s<377>                        the CDC states in their own report that ebola is airborne within three feet or the same room
s<419>                        REPUBLICANS are COMMUNIST FOOLS!!!
s<427>                        A lot has changed since obama told you that ( and lied ) LMAO
s<439>                        Democrats DENOUNCED GOD, so shut your crack hole!
s<482>                        Clue for the truly out of touch. There are no flights between the U.S and West Africa.
s<485>                        What airline? What is the schedule?
s<520>                        Finally lost his common sense?  You can't lose something that you never had.
s<521>                        sorry...he never had any common sense
s<557>                        They have always said it can be transmitted by body fluids, and I believe the water droplets you refer to is a body fluid. Why don't you look at the number of people in the US that has died from Ebola (1) and then look up how many have died from gunshots during the same period.(over 31000 a year = over 87 per day) You will find you have a much greater chance of being shot than catching Ebola. People should worry more about bullets than water droplets. Put all that fear you have blaming the wrong people and fight to find a way to stop those 87 a day that are dying. You could be saving yourself or a loved one. God Bless
n<560>                        It makes me feel good that you and I are fellow Americans and understand how important it is to stop this horrid disease.
s<593>                        Nahzuul, nothing is impossible look at the pyramids, great wall in China your smartphone, list goes on it can be done easily ..if you place the right people in charge and act on it immediately
n<600>                        well mr president, why don't you visit these countries and chat with the health care workers and extend an open invitation for them to come to the white house on their return trip. michelle can get all dressed up and the two of you can extend your arms to welcome them home or welcome them to America. when you do this, we will all change our minds
s<613>                        *welcome.
s<614>                    Ebola has been around for 40 years. Why didn't Ford,Carter,Regan,Bush,Clinton or Bush Jr do anything about it. It's not Obama's fault.
s<625>                        Because ALL the experts have advised him against closing the borders.
n<642>                        Ebola is the greatest threat america has ever seen, Rachel. Greta was just highlighting this fact a few minutes ago.
n<709>                        Do you also think that people who use condoms are paranoid? Is your dentist paranoid because s/he wears latex gloves? To not quarantine these workers is a threat to my Life, Liberty and Pursuit of Happiness.
s<729>                        The coward is you, Bluejacket.  You are not man enough to face the fact that Ebola is not an air born disease, and can only be contacted by direct contact with someone with the disease. 
s<731>                    THESE PEOPLE AT NOT HEROES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
n<780>                        Everyone we've brought back for treatment has been a US citizen.
s<855>                        Go play in traffic
n<859>                    Well we certainly can't now that we're already importing it, you dumbas,s piece of shet. I say burn all of west Africa to the ground with incendiary bomb strikes and euthanize any confirmed carriers. No carriers = no Ebola. What should have been done with HIV back in 1981 when a test for it became available. Otherwise we sure as heII can try to seal ourselves off while West Africa dies out or survives on it's own. Why should we give a shet about Africa if we don't import it like idiots? Shouldn't be too hard to simply ban all travel to/from any country with more than 2 cases if you are not going to euthanize them.
s<867>                        interesting point maybe Stalin and Hitler would have teamed up on us. Its like having a teenager for president.
s<895>                    I think we need a new constitutional amendment just for the Republicans
s<994>                    We can and the military knows how to do it.  So suck it up AH and listen to your advisors
n<1027>                    The President is right. I"m ashamed of the people in my country who are so frightened of Ebola they're trying to throw away the Constitutional rights of dedicated, hard-working citizens simply because fear mongers are spreading lies.
s<1049>                        and your comments are not political???  Try and focus.
s<1108>                    Can't believe those stiffs were actually willing to wear the white coats the administration hands out to create its "visual". Looks ridiculous and effected. What doctor wears a white coat to visit the President.
s<1122>                        That is cute.  You think the government is sending the healthcare workers...
s<1124>                    Look at those lemmings in the photo (especially that adoring look from the black woman) fawning over that CANCER we call a "president". I guess being smart has no bearing on whether you have common sense, huh?
n<1177>                    "We can't hermetically seal ourselves off...." This coming from a guy who is holed up in the White House that has a steel fence around its perimeter, with secret service guards, and angry dogs to keep folks away from him.  He can't get his paid hack "Ebola Czar" to show his face in public because he is so uninformed that he can't  get the "Lie of the Day" digested for publication.  Thank God the military isn't listening to this political drivel that's for the lefts' consumption.  The sooner Obama goes the better and safer this country will be.
s<1198>                        along with my detractors...
s<1293>                        Who didn't recover from ebola in Texas?
s<1299>                        Actually, maybe you're unqualified to be called a human being.
s<1303>                        Global warming is the new religion of the left. . .SCIENTISTS have proven the temp hasn't risen in 18 years, the ice is not melting on either pole, the polar bears are not dying, the water is NOT rising (though some land is eroding, making it appear that way). . 
s<1329>                        My health insurance was not cancelled; it was made much better.  No cancellation for pre-existing conditions.  Even you, being indigent, are covered.
s<1383>                        take a fruit loop flavored valium
s<1430>                    The only one "sealed off" in this mess is Obama.
s<1453>                    VOTE OUT ALL Dumocrats this coming election so we can stop Obama in his tracks from doing stupid things and wasting tax payer money and risking all of our health.
s<1507>                    As Paul Krugman( who was once a staunch B.O, critic) said this last week in an interview:::
n<1573>                    Our leaders need to be cautious about Ebola. I don't want to hear the president tell us we need no restrictions. We need restrictions. Don't tell me that Dr on the NY subway should have been there. I don't believe it. That's irresponsible. Nobody wants an epidemic here in the US !  Take precautions !  Healthcare workers in West Africa are important. More important is not starting an epidemic here in the US
s<1644>                    We have 17+ Trillion reasons + Ebola to NEVER vote Republican.
s<1679>                        Yeah, mindless third world hate can be like that.
s<1684>                        well, we are all what we are first. i am a white woman, and an american. 
s<1732>                        Exactly Vlad. Why do you think that oranges are orange? THIS IS NO COINCIDENCE.
s<1748>                        That's what we are hoping for, but it looks like Obama has won this round.
n<1758>                        There are so many self-centered, short-sighted lowlife that insist on being too stupid to understand that these healthcare workers are doing more to keep Ebola out of the U.S. than all of the moronic hate rants from the Tea trash.
n<1761>                    Seems like Dr. Frieden is under quarantine as is the new Ebola Czar. Haven't seen anything of them since the appointment. Instead of the nurse being seen as a self-sacrificing do-gooder who has helped a foreign country out with its Ebola problem, she will be remembered as a selfish person who cares more about foreign citizens than her own American citizens. Twenty-one  days to ensure the safety of her fellow citizens at her age is not a sacrifice. Remember that every day in different parts of the world there are American men and women dying to preserve the very freedoms you take for granted.
n<1774>                    It's 21 freaking days! What is wrong with this country and our President !?! 21 days to ensure safety of our neighbors, friends and family isn't that much to ask. Of course we can't 'hermetically seal' ourselves off but we can stop the disease from spreading from those we know  could be contagious.
s<1776>                    This idiot and common sense never could see eye to eye.
s<1780>                    What a friggin crock! And to think, stupid America voted fo this clown twice!
s<1803>                    Obama twice now the citizens have walked out on your black a[s]s[ this should tell you something like shut the hell up we don't care about you or your admin any more
s<1804>                    Since when does AMERICA stand by and watch Obama - this Third World Tird - INVITE a DEADLY CONTAGIOUS DISEASE across the Oceans? At what point does this qualify as DERELICT OF DUTY? Other Countries have had Dictators that were declared the enemy of the people for their outrageous conduct. AMERICA had them all MURDERED. What's the problem here?
s<1818>                    Another speech that's all .  he's full of s.....h.......I....t... If you believe anything he says your full to.
s<1866>                    president photo op at it again, must have a truckload of white jackets......how racist
n<1878>                    A bit of a God-complex working there, thinking he can speak a new Reality into being. The US can very much seal itself off. Don't issue visas in countries with Ebola for a start.
s<1922>                    Just when I think Obama couldn't be more of a Dumb@#$, he talks again...
s<1925>                    GOP's good, Obama's bad! Right t-begging sheeple?
n<1945>                    Why can't we seal ourselves off from Ebola?  Why bring it here to treat when it can and has been treated there successfully?
s<1946>                    Well not when we have a dolt the likes of you for a leader we can't. If there's any justice in the universe, you'll be the first to die when the plague erupts here at home due to your incipet idiotic lack of anything even resembling responsible leadership. Jesus this has been the longest 6 F ing years in the History of the United States.
s<1952>                    OBAMA MOST OF THE COUNTRY IS FRUSTRATED WITH YOU.PERIOD.
s<1971>                    do hope buckwheat and family gets EBOLA!!!!
s<1991>                    Words alone never fed a hungry or sick child, right Bubba?
s<2007>                    He has an even more unstable look in his eyes in that particular photo.
s<2016>                    We need ebola in this country so that we can vaccinate it.
s<2017>                    Impeach obama hes done enough damage.
s<2019>                    Translation: I would gladly sacrifice many Americans to save a few a Africans.....
n<2038>                    Obama is saying I'm siding with them and not the American people, if he will not close our borders for our security, can not, means will not and by not raises questions of why, do not tell me not to question the gov when they are know to make rules for the people, which do not include them.
n<2045>                    We will never succeed if we don't try.  What's wrong with protecting Americans, first?
n<2119>                    whay can't we seal ourselves of?? quarantine has a long and effective history behind it, How about placing the best interests of America as a primary consideration for once?  If it saves one life, it is worth it!
n<2121>                    It is funny how other countries don't have a problem not letting people from infected areas enter their COUNTRIES WAKE UP ODUMMER
s<2138>                    I'd like to see a few (if not all) of Obamas Administration contract Ebola.  Maybe then they would begin to use some common sense...  Then again, maybe not !!!
n<2169>                    I hate his guts! corruption is all that's on his mind. No more people carrying that disease should be allowed back in the US.
s<2183>                    And................ the Epidemiologists can talk too?......OK let's hear what Biden's butler wants to say.
s<2220>                    This guy needs to be impeach .  Get him out of office time for a new president . This guy doesnt care about american citizens.
n<2221>                    Typical leftist exaggeration. Absolutely no one is talking about sealing off the country, but are talking about slowing the spread of the disease while medical research and preparation are  adapting. Plain and precise language mean nothing to career politicians.
n<2223>                    This idiot obviously wants to kill us!  The ONLY way we can protect ourselves from Ebola is to seal up the borders.  That is the ONLY way.  You do NOT deliberately invite people with a killer disease to walk on it.  I think Obama hates us, and he is trying to get us killed.
s<2239>                    we should send obama there personally
n<2268>                    How about you stop all flights from and to Africa and quarantine all potential victims?
s<2303>                    Obama wants to share the gift of his muddaland, African 'culcha', with the entire human species!!
s<2307>                    beware Obama and the health care industry want us to foot the bill for all these sick Africans - hell NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  we are broke thanks to obummer
s<2326>                    Obama is a sleeze bag extraordinaire and only wants to pander for self serving attention.
s<2357>                    wish we could send him back to africa. dam democrats
s<2360>                    Why does he not get his sorry #$%$ over there.
s<2362>                    Obama sounds like an idiot puppet, just regurgitating what he has been programmed to say. Pitiful
n<2370>                    Can't or won't? Are we the only nation that can't seal itself? Really? Yes we can...Repeat it after me. Yes we can, yes we can, yes we can......
n<2385>                    Hermetically sealing USA is impossible when we can't even seal the borders - as Obama's executive order lets anyone come in.
s<2410>                    oh ueah ? well before obama we never had a case of ebola here but now with his direction we have a bunch. just because he said it doesnt make it so, as usual. i dont see how this quack has remained alive for 8 years of presidency, must be divinely ordained to punish this nation of baby killers and homosex fools.
s<2420>                    Hillary Clinton - Elizabeth Warren 2016... Forward.!
s<2444>                    Read us  "The Masque of the Red Death" again Uncle Barack.
s<2462>                    Lie after lie after lie. He won't answer and real questions and won't do anything real to help.
s<2464>                    2016 cant get here fast enough, Hopefully next Tuesday the Republicans can win the Senate and at least slow this Muslim/Socialist President down...............
s<2485>                    Mother of man killed by illegal immigrant: Obama is ignoring us
s<2486>                    This President is trying to set his legacy.
n<2524>                    In other words, he doesn't think the disease can be contained, so don't even try. Terrific. He's probably right though, considering there is no such thing as immigration law anymore where our borders are concerned. If or when a genuine Ebola outbreak hits the US, pray that it doesn't start mutating.
s<2571>                    Another Yahoo headline reads "nation totally unprepared for ebola", but Oblunder thinks we should embrace it just like he has the free flow of illegals across the border. This man thinks and speaks with his fourth point of contact.
s<2579>                    Then do tell dear Blamer in Chief why the pentagon has determined that the military returning from west africa will be quarantined prior to their return? Another example of the leftist morons and their "do as I say, not as I do" attitude.  There has to be a change in the senate to stop this meglomaniac from killing us all!
s<2588>                    The people voted for "change."  Not even a ouija board could have predicted this.
s<2600>                    When are you finished barry??  Two more long years is it??
n<2606>                    Everyone...call 800-933-1518 and put yourself on a petition to seal off the border and ban travel to the hot zones.  Do it now before it's too late.
s<2615>                    Obama..Obozo. .. Obolo......its all the same desease
s<2618>                    He is crazy
s<2625>                    Am I supposed to be more convinced when he has a bunch of "white coats" standing behind him?
s<2629>                    Obola wants it to spread
n<2656>                    Yes we can seal ourselves off.  And we should.
s<2657>                    Did this guy realllllly go to Harvard? I need to see those transcripts. I don't believe they let in people with such debilitating cognitive dissonance.
s<2750>                    the sky is falling
s<2766>                    OBVIOUSLY, 
s<2769>                    The president doesn't have to "hermetically seal" himself off. He has a 1/2 million dollar hospital bed (along with the best Ebola doctors) at his beckoned call, UNLIKE the rest of America.
s<2773>                    OBOLA IS A TRAITOR.  HE MUST BE ARRESTED NOW FOR HIS TREASON AGAINST THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
s<2795>                    Who really gives a rats aas what this incompetent blamer says.
s<2805>                    Seal off odumba is what he meant to say.
s<2826>                    Hey Obama
s<2869>                    The most useless idiotic anti-American president ever. Congrats Obama on achieving that status you ignoramus.
s<2896>                    When trying to fix a leak in a boat while in the water. Would your rather have several large holes or a small one? IE. Why make your job a thousand percent harder without sensible quarantine periods?
s<2905>                    .......and our divine supreme leader is planning to allow infected W. Africans to be flown to America for treatment.
s<2907>                    Jeez effin' hell, where does this idiot get his medical advice. Every other country is restricting entry form Ebola countries. Of course it works.
s<2920>                    Derelect of Duty????
s<2953>                    Something tells me that the uber rich and upper political douche bags will be safe
s<2976>                    "OBOLA" WAS CONTAINED FOR 40 YRS IN AFRICA, UNTIL OBAMA LET IT IN AMERICA THRU HIS OWN PEN SIGNING NEW RULES FOR VISAS &amp; NO MORE "BIG TIME CUSTOMS INSPECTIONS" THAT HAVE KEPT IT OUT OF AMERICA FOR 40 YEARS.... The Traitor In the White House NEEDS TO BE REMOVED, Now.
s<2983>                    A failed community organizer with DEEP ties to TERRORIST ORGANIZERS is now in charge of protecting America. What could go wrong with that?
s<3010>                    the AMERICAN PEOPLE BY A WIDE MARGIN BEG TO DIFFER, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ALMOST ALL OF THEM WANT TRAVEL BAN ETC...
n<3014>                    Well ... it's just as easy to seal ourselves off from obola as it is to seal ourselves off from "terrorists" and the latter hasn't stopped our corporate fascist police state government one bit from trying .... or so they say.
s<3025>                    Didn't he just say a few weeks ago the chances of it getting here were remote?
s<3031>                    Why does President Obama keep taking photo ops of him hugging &amp; shaking hands with people once they are over the contagious stage? Hug them when they come fresh off the plane &amp; are running around while taking their temperature twice a day for 21 days. That's when people are worried they have a chance of catching this! Why does he always have to try &amp; make everyone look so stupid &amp; then he wants your respect?
s<3035>                    813 days until our country won't have to listen to him anymore. Hagel say's "lets protect America from possible outbreaks from our returning troops". Odimwit says about our returning doctor's and nurse's" ah no worry."
s<3043>                    President Barack Ebola and the Obama virus... in Africa of all places. His black brothers were and are dying; and this guy waited all summer before deciding to do anything for his fellow black brothers.
s<3050>                    No we can't, but we sure as hell can take precautions, which it appears our government doesn't want to take!
s<3064>                    How many innocent children did 0bamAssad murder today?
s<3104>                    why not obama you managed to seal yours and moochelles records
s<3189>                    Obama's plan to put people to work is Ebola!
s<3204>                    I guarantee you, Obola, if your lack of concern causes an oubreak in these US of A, and you try to impose martial law as a means of control, that you will pay for infecting this country.
s<3211>                    obama is just plain bullsht
s<3262>                    Sadly, every day I ask myself why somebody hasn't capped this arrogant, ignorant, idiot yet.  I have never thought this about any other President as long as I've been alive.
s<3265>                    I love how every doctor,nurse and scientist says the same thing.That there shouldnt be a quarantine and you right wing fox "news" loving fools are crazy and paranoid.That doesnt stop you all from crying and whining that Ebolas gonna kill us all!! though..
s<3270>                    Obola has totally destroyed America!!!!! Are you happy, Libs????
s<3278>                    My name is Barack Hussein and i'm insane. I'm also a racist American hating pig.
n<3317>                    Actually it can, it is called quarantine. The mega-surveillance state cant keep track of people who have been in west african outbreak countries and deny them entry? I bet if they had back taxes due we would know exactly where they are. Obama is full of #$%$....as usual.
s<3372>                    WHY Not? What does Obama know? He is a clue. Nothing! He has made bad decisions on everything. The guy is a loser plain and simple.
s<3391>                    well mr president give it to yourself and your family first,like a true leader!!! and then say how we can't isolate ourselves!! and do it with out tax payer health care!!!!
n<3425>                    Typical Obama, create an extreme straw man and then attack it.  Nobody is suggesting we stop health care providers from going overseas to provide assistance. Few are objecting to sending troops to help.  The reality is that we have a double standard.  Troops will be quarantined and U.S. and foreign civilians will not.  Obama needs to step up and say if his policies lead to an outbreak in the US then it is his fault for not implementing better monitoring and control of those exposed.  Ever american death from such an outbreak would be on his head.
s<3448>                    everyone wish's we could seal ourselves from Crupper Obama..What a waste of skin ...I pray we survive him
s<3452>                    "US can't seal itself off".......Ummmm actually we can you fu (k!ng uber Liberal , Trying to turn America into a third world county POS!!!!
s<3459>                    O'donkey is a fool. Hurting our country and embarrassing us in front of the world.
s<3462>                    You righties would have a point, IF Ebola was as easy to spread or as widespread as your ignorance and paranoia.  But, fact is, it isn't.  I guarantee, you have more to worry about your own stupidity than you do from Ebola.  But, you are probably too dumb to recognize that.
s<3472>                    what an a hole
n<3476>                    He changes the argument from people who want to stop commercial flights from the Ebola stricken countries, and makes it absurd.  He maintains that people want to seal off the United States.  What we'd like is a President who doesn't lie every time he breathes and who exercises some commonsense.  It's not just whether or no people get infected, its the useless waste of money following people around to make sure no one is infected.
s<3484>                    this must be another one of obamas plans for us, send isis and ebola, he must really be immune from getting any thing, so he wants to send everything our way, how sick can he be to even think like he does
n<3502>                    Yes we can! Close the borders to these potential infected people! Duncan LIED to two countries immigration services and he is dead, and spread the disease! We are lucky we are not like some 3d world dump like in Africa. Sorry Ebola doesn't fit in with you illegal voter immigration policies Obama!
s<3504>                    I saw another headline that says the U.S. is not ready to handle this.
s<3519>                    "we can't shut ourselves off" --- "cautions against restrictions" --- now there's a leader for ya. The master of double-speak strikes again.
s<3613>                    What's next: We can't protect ourselves from Russia, we can't regulate against Wall Street financial collapse, we can't afford to educate our kids, we can't police crime on our streets...geez, let's just do nothing then?
s<3622>                    of all the big threats out there , it's going to be one of these little bitty viruses that "does us in" ..... watch
s<3638>                    again our traitor in chief is treasonous to the end.
s<3640>                    GOP = Recessions.
s<3662>                    What a dum-bama!
s<3673>                    Tell that to California! LOL Where all your buddies just told you to F off! They are quarantining.
s<3706>                    2009-2016: The lost years of the United States of America
s<3724>                    Ah,,, Mr Prez.. aka main brother... yes we can seal off Ebola... its real eazy
s<3760>                    Since Obama has such a case of the #$%$ with these states and their quarantine measures because he is so absolutely sure there is no danger, let's do this.
s<3769>                    I hope that S O B catches Ebola (aka. Obola) and bleeds out. My health insurance just went up over 50% because of that socialist P O S.
s<3818>                    Why doesn't he just sign an executive order and tell it to stay there. He uses it for everything else.
s<3833>                    The absolute worst US President in our history!
s<3834>                    Shut the hell up Obama, you are loser and a #$%$ hole to leave the USA to your nasty African family running here sick for us to save here. You're a poor excuse for a president.
s<3873>                    obama,without your help,we can try!!!
n<3896>                    This guy should be prosecuted for allowing this to happen.  Other nations have sealed their borders but not the snake in drag.
s<3912>                    Obama is just trying to save face -Travel bans and quarantines obviously work.  There is no evidence it would effect getting medical personal and supplies to the countries that need them
s<3913>                    Yes, you ignorant monkey, we can. Or at least we can do our best, which will decrease the chance of it coming here. The only thing stopping this country from being a safer place is obama himself.
n<3923>                    This man's an idiot.  And, any volunteer working with Ebola patients should be made "well aware" of a quarantine upon leaving the country they're in or the country to which they're traveling.  This isn't an effort to show disrespect to these people...it just makes sense.  THEY (if any) should know this.
s<3973>                    The PC JV team at work.
s<3998>                    Obama you are an idiot to the 10th power!!
s<4061>                    Just imagine ISIS terrorists going into Ebola regions to get the disease and then coming to the US as they can come in from Mexico, then use their sewage as a weapon; imagine renting a crop duster and filling it with 500 gallons of sewage and spraying it over a city as everyone that gets sprayed on has the potential of contracting Ebola.
s<4146>                    "(Don't Fear) Ebola"
s<4147>                    IF IT IS NO THREAT HAVE THE DOCTORS RETURNING STAY WITH YOU AND SHARE A BED . IT WOULD PROVE THE POINT AND MAY GET RID OF YOU !!!!!!!!!
s<4177>                    Obama got an anti-Ebola blood plazma transfusion from Dr. Brantly last week.
s<4187>                    So glad that he governs with logic, reason and rationality, rather than reaction.
s<4188>                    THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS when you elect a man with no
s<4226>                    we cant quarantine west africa.......tha t s where obamas vital interests lie
s<4256>                    I do not see Obama getting on a plan and going to the west African countries  where the ebola out break is taking place.
n<4261>                    Actually we can.  Or at least we could have if that moron hadn't let the disease in already.
s<4272>                    A different Yahoo article says our troops will have a 21 day quarantine when they return from the affected areas.  I guess obama doesn't want to treat them with the "dignity and respect" that he offers the healthcare workers.  No surprise.
s<4336>                    Umm, the African nations bordering the Ebola infected nations DID, 
s<4339>                    "The modern conservative is engaged in one of man's oldest exercises in moral philosophy; that is, the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness."
s<4352>                    After his rousing speech, President Obama urged republicans to visit Africa and "get really close to someone with Ebola there" while Democrats stayed in America and continue to fix it just like the last five years.
s<4367>                    Obama won't stop the Africans he want's to get as many as possibly here to give them illegal citizenship  .
