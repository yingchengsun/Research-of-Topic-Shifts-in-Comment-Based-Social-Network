Then, Spurs started passing again. started taking chances offensively backing Heat��s poor spacing end. script completely flipped, Miami knew it, defending champs points road, impressive 16-point advantage distant memory. Shot shot went in, James�� teammates failed step help two-time Finals MVP, time confetti settled, Spurs taken Game 104-87 score won 2013-14 NBA championship utilizing impressive team play league seen since, well, last time Spurs won title.

One month season, Houston Rockets took Duncan��s Spurs, Charles Barkley exclaimed reporters ��seen future,�� wore Duncan��s uniform number. Charles couldn��t possibly talking June making apt declaration. 

Duncan scored points, added eight boards two blocks, offered usual expert help defense win, finishing series averages points rebounds, looking like sort player June o2015. San Antonio overcame miserable shooting night former Finals MVP Tony Parker, shot 7-of-18 way points (missing first field) win James continually went underneath screens set Parker, daring shoot. 

Shoot did, missing quite along way, Miami��s defensive maneuver allowed Spurs start possessions far closer basket usual, eventually poor spacing caught Miami. Manu Ginobili keyed first half surge finished points four assists, Patty Mills came Spurs bench toss blistering points making 5-of-8 three-pointers. Miami unable counter end, going long stretches without scoring, completely incapable setting anything offensively didn��t heavily rely James damage individually.

spy Leonard��s play body language early on, apparent going star-in-waiting aid San Antonio comeback. veteran teammates appeared little shook unsure initial Miami onslaught, Leonard still moved without ball offensively, making series intelligent moves end even James racked points. unflappable despite early deficit, Heat settled down, Leonard��s active play eventually began offer tangible results. 

third year swingman finished points rebounds, staying strong second half well, giving Spurs sort all-around demon Miami��s older legs just couldn��t counter. obvious, even Spurs double digit points early, going Leonard��s night. 

didn��t completely shut James down, one ever could, LeBron ended 2013-14 season 31-point, 10-rebound, five-assists two-block line. Leonard earned Finals MVP trophy, though, especially night potential candidates (Tony Parker particular) struggled mightily gate. 

questions surrounding Miami��s future �C James, Bosh Dwyane Wade can become free agents next month choose route �C another day. Wade clearly decline, Bosh still struggles find fit Miami��s offense, LeBron James looked absolutely fatigued stretch deciding Game 5. outfit may take litany championships James half-jokingly predicted them, reach Finals four consecutive seasons, NBA feat haven��t seen three decades, amount 2014-level disappointment summertime intrigue future can take away two championship rings. 

San Antonio? franchise back belongs, top NBA��s figurative heap, past Spurs legends David Robinson Bruce Bowen Jaren Jackson Avery Johnson Speedy Claxton proud shared ball embraced role players putting position create succeed. Tired sportswriter-isms ��playing right way�� valuing team usually rightfully responded appropriate eye rolls, Spurs team absolute pleasure take in.
