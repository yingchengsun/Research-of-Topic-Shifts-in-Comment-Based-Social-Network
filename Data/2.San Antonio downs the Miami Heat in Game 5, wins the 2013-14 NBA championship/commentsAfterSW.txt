n*<r9> Lebron play heart out, sat last minutes game sulking feeling sorry himself. Pathetic Lebron fans, want give credit what? quitter good leader? should've floor rest starters trying mount come back even minutes go. heart! 
s*<r12> @stop lies, Jordan sat bench like little baby. Jordan real deal, Lebron still behind Kobe ask me. 
s*<r14> @Ruiz: really think James game wanted there? Spoelstra coach, James franchise. James wants Spoelstra gone gone. Spoelstra wants James gone Spoelstra gone. 
s*<r17> Stop Lies: Lebron individually statistically absolutely killed SAS. team sport. 
n*<r18> @Rulz Lebron factor second half last game. Past NBA legends always played harder second half counted, first quarter. give SAS credit, shut second half surprise since Lebron habit fading towards end important games defense zero's limited moves help. 
s<c19> Yeah rest league can take notes championship team. Nowadays focus star power BIG front office trades/signings really need teamwork developing players. Kawahi traded George Hill role player now look him. Danny Green won Finals MVP last year neither getting million year. right direction league. Good job Spurs! 
n<c25> found owner's comment team America bit funny considering international flavor Spurs. great team great champion! Congratulations. reason think next year everybody comes back. year seemed stay reasonably healthy. can Pop excellent job managing time, see reason repeat. Lakers fan long time but, fun watch Spurs win another one 'Cow Town'! lol! ; p 
n<c26> Spurs much love respect one another. want succeed. Nobody wants top dog outshine anyone else. One reasons great care team mates themselves. Unselfish, classy players great "Pop" thank it. Love Spurs proud them. also happy Kawhi got MVP. amazing. Love Spurs!!! 
n*<r27> Ditto Cassandra...I will miss watching games every week! 
n<c28> Team playing won. Lebron team looked weak tired, just mustard. Wade Duncan end careers will see teams make adjustments next year can again. see MJ court last two games, you? even see MVP court except Tim Duncan two guards played game perfectly. Two really bad games HEAT 110% ashamed.... Never say going WIN get beat 20ish "Bosh". Next year will WARRIORS turn win big one. 
s*<r30> thing Wade Timmy 38, large difference basket ball years. TImmy however never played injuries lot minutes. TImmy still viable well preserved. 
s*<r34> take money two rings. 
s*<r39> also hope Jerry took note, know not! 
s*<r50> Malone much talented, biased Jazz fan. :p 
n*<r51> laker fan Kobe fan really mind Duncan will win next championships. Spurs reminded us basketball TEAM sport. =) 
s*<r54> take anything away duncan best power forward one best run teams 90s 2000s....duncans beast team aspect s.a. made duncan is....thats hes good cause thought team first stats......many power forwards hang duncan skillwise many team attitude duncan 
s*<r58> Laker fan, yes am, will stand premise. saying offensive machine, FG % .500. Personally, believe Noah playing position, PF instead C. 
s*<r61> John's team's biggest weakness center, forwards strong. Guard play interesting since Magic Oscar great duel Kobe vs. Jordan prime epic, believe difference low. tempted put Pistol Pete shooting guard like Jordan-Bryant match-up. 
s<c63> forget, Ray Allen missed Game 3-pointer last year, Heat lost Spurs...they went games last year nearly lost it. Heat better team, won thanks lucky (and desperate shot). win Thunder two years ago legit, although won thanks LeBron Wade flopping just every possession cheap fouls called Thunder. 
n*<r64> Mauricio right, gthe Spurs better team last year too. just blew it. made Heat pay year arguably dominating finals series ever. 
s<r72> ROLE! 
s<r73> LB will soon get new name called Lebeg. going beg another superstar like Cameltlow join team make stars team win another title NBA. Kawhi Lebeg Wade killer. will continue lebeg's mind haunted. Thanks Kawhi spurs players shutting annoying sounds Miami summer. swept cats 1st round, beat Nets 2nd, went Pacers 3rd got wheels broken running Texas. also remember Lebeg said wanted Spurs finals heat cried past years. 
s<r75> OMG! real player without tatoos i.e. Kawhi? 
n<r76> Kawhi's humbleness make perfect fit w/ Spurs. kid became superstar last week so. 
n<c82> First, let say mean disrespect Tony Gwynn family, believe one best players/hitters time. However, Heat asked better situation right now. just utterly humiliated NBA Finals far superior team (that also beaten last year). hype Lebron LeBron-ettes get heads LeBron's kester sports media (ESPN) built foundation sand. one LeBron fan club likes talk LeBron loses, get TV wins. Now fan club excuse talk Heat's epic failure. promise Gwynn's death lead story Heat just won 5. LeBron may best game today, continues show far best all-time. arguably work team Jordan, Jordan far, far success. People say many LeBron haters (and may considered category). However, hating point facts. One facts ain't cracked far much back can list here. all, blown away proves it. just lucky swept came close that. 
n<c86> Lakers fan, here. biased favor west, say following without bias. truly enjoy watching cheering Spurs. like great old-school high school team everything right. happy every player team Pops staff. Congrats San Antonio. 
n<r88> Actually, finally saw concession media tonight. lauding Spurs' team play talk LeBron once. course, stop referring LeBron best player world (truly annoying), finally give Spurs due. 
s<r109> take Mav's Heat best seven. MAV's, OKC, Clippers best them. 
n<r110> First all...GO MAVS! Second, glad heat win. Respect spurs, BUILT team buy way in. Also, gotta figure miami's nightmares now, TEXAS teams built hard work handed #$%$ year period. Guess NBA still some-what happy ending. "Anyone heat" indeed. 
s<r114> Spurs will waiting! 
s<r115> Bring on, baby! ready! :) 
s<r121> Jazz fan. Hope win one game Spurs next year. 
s<r123> Based history...the Heat put team self past seasons, right? 
n<r137> JDB, comments spot on. Spurs organization players hard quantify. watching tonight David Robinson, Sean Elliot, Avery Johnson, Bruce Bowen floor team, celebrating another championship. Robinson interviewed said best. part Spurs, "family," always remain part family. may never see another group like lifetime, times changed. just going sit back you, savor moment. Go Spurs Go! 
n<c145> Congratulations San Antonio Spurs. live city erupted. Military drive fire! happened better bunch guys. love team. Watching Timmy get emotional tear jerker.

n<c150> Heat fan congratulate Spurs job well done. really felt Spoelstra coached. Spurs players listened coach went it. big three Spurs together long time know stick together. Heat big three together years now still learning. learned handle hate criticism point matter just go business trying win championship. lost Mavericks hurt time around much big thank great season. Carmelo Anthony want happen happen. Sign draft young defensive minded guys bring big blue collar guys size. fun Spurs fan last year. Enjoy cheers. will see NBA fans next season. Good night.

Even Lakers missed playoffs. team perfectly coached won classic team. played basketball like suppose played might ever see team like again. Congrats San Antonio Spurs. 
n<r191> agree 100% above. interesting note: mighty Miami supposed be, TrailBlazers actually smaller total point spread margin Miami (Portland lost series Spurs points less Miami). 
s<r193> kind team may end Spurs assistant coach spread around league growing new teams style hopefully save NBA turning scripted Hollywood movie. 
s<r197> Ronald go back gaybar boy 
s<r200> ...it team sport last two years too!...LOL!

s<c229> LOVE SPURS!! dedicated, humble, articulate, genuinely love coach. despise LeBron James everything represents. glad got served!! 
s<r230> despise Lebron, Tim Duncan exhibits nothing class professionalism. Makes easy root him. Glad one thumb now. 
n<c232> Spurs Champions, many congratulations Spurs Players, Pop, Owner Fans. 
n<c235> Congrats, Spurs!!! often team wins NBA title PURE intelligence. Mind you, great things Heat ARE, intelligent make list. 
s<c236> Can debate end dynasty, one shining brighter today, like Celtics, Lakers Bulls best basketball team time period. 
n<c238> San Antonio Spurs left doubt better team series. Way go SPURS 
s<c244> NBA just realize pleasure watch real basketball get away trying generate next mega superstar better league. Take notice NBA, real bball fans want real bball, congrats spurs! 
n<r246> Exactly !! never watched much NBA all, playoffs finals...but series got attention !! actually looking forward watching NBA next season ( knows...maybe Hornets will step play " Team " ball like Spurs year ! ) 
s<r252> really so? Kobe done anything whine. take million less year keep team together? Timmy, Tony Manu did. 
s<c256> Michael Jordan Chicago Bulls never cast longer shadow now. fashionable compare Heat legendary bulls team, consider last years finals SA's year's beat Heat, discussion passe. 
s<r259> thought put tonight guess tired. just lacking fire, heart. stubbornness Jordan, Pippen, Kobe have. 
n<r264> partners, DWade Bosh, gotten old sudden. LeBron best planet, just like Jordan was, developed level trust since Dallas Finals. man game, team game, trouble is, rest Heat no-shows. 
s<r266> just glad see hear stupid Sir Charles series, SUX! 
s<c268> know heard wrong pregame telecast last night one announcers said Heat needed go get physical, throw elbows, etc. way can win. shocked. kitchen heard came cut commercial know said it. anyone else hear something effect last night? 
n<c273> TEAM BASKETBALL: great fun watch action. better team prevailed overhyped stars. 
n<c275> Teams usually beat talented individuals. 
s<c278> always cool watch fundamentally sound team shred another. 
s<c286> Love Leonard never gets upset makes faces ref calls...never. seems like man playing boys beating continue make faces, complain etc. fun watch. 
s<c289> just glad basketball season over. nearly All-Star break baseball. 
n<c290> Like said previous comments; Spurs "Weapons Destruction" kept tempo going destroy Heat (with Team Empowerment). LeBron just one man team. Lets go Sports going (Soccer?). Nice Day. 
s<r298> record wise top three teams qualified West. Heat lacked real challenge got West finals. 
n<c305> want apologize Manu Ginobli. Spurs brought back amount money got paid bit livid. figure done reckless type play (like JR Smith/Westbrook) take shots need to. watching playoffs.. three tie OKC.. play finals owe huge apology. really stepped up. entire team stepped up. Congratulations Spurs now Popovich can go vacation.. last year said Finals loss 
s<c306> Spurs team basketball personified. 
s<r318> agree, Brian. like trying convince us best player 
s<r319> NBA coaches, players pundits (who haters) credit Lebron best player game today. guess Brian know basketball Isabella. 
s<r320> "trying convince us best player" fool. Every knowledgable basketball man player syas without hesitation best player, even close. issue hating guy see truth, make mdeia's issue. never liked (still don't) Jordan, best era matter much like him. 
n<c324> Miami Heat legitimate big man point guard even close Tony Parker Chris Paul. So, built use 3-point shot advantage. Unfortunately, lost shooting touch finals. Check numbers. hitting 3s previously playoffs. story. Yes, San Antonio played basketball way meant played bench world, Heat get decent looks, go time around. Spoelstra, protege Riley, suffered Riley suffered Knicks Heat prior big three. refuse allow bench players play grow season ready playoffs. continually overuse starting five cost year. pray make moves even though big men available, point guard serious handle huge plus. need clean house, trade Bosh order get center/power forward, great. think, however, Bosh command attention. Hey, maybe Pau Gasol like come here!!!! huge!!!! proud Miami Heat excitement last years. Now, just need get couple players help us see bench actually let play!!!! 
s<r325> cheat heat need clean house start D Wade shot out, bosh thinks defense tabu, chalmers allen need understand Lebron one can get away using elbow 
n<c326> Congratulations Spurs dominant, impressive NBA final. 
s<r328> classy post John. 
s<c330> amazing work Greg Popovich continues year year number various "no-name" players amazing, undeniable. system emphasizes team play like head coach ever seen. seriously considered best time. 
n<c343> said couple days ago win three, Spurs playing basketball well ever seen played series, passing, finding open man, getting ball hot hand, aggressive defense, mention defense? grew watching great Laker teams playing great Celtics, Bad Boys Detroit, Michael Bulls, great, know EVER seen better team ball Spurs series. 
n<r346> haven't. Good comparisons, move ball like Spurs. 
s<c353> sure ever seen Timmy smile much! Great see Dave, Sean Avery celebrate Pop team. 
n<c360> Kawhi definitely earned MVP. showed big last games proved major factor Spurs play. commentators kept saying looked like star every time pulled shot. never rattled showed future franchise. 
s<r364> sad thing isthe cheat heat fans will never get dismantled 
s<c369> Michael Jordan made everyone better around him. questioning better Lebron vs MJ debate holding heads shame doubting even second. 
n<r375> year proved Spurs gave away last year 
n<c376> spurs team. heat collection players. 
n<c382> Miami heat lost NBA FINALS, way lost last three games forever exposed huge defensive liability! system broken, remedy! arrogance proclaiming world will win "one,.., two,.., three,.., six,.." forever pulverized!The much vaunted big three big disarray, now Spurs annihilated NBA FINALS!I watched snippet game 5, pay homages end short-lived Miami Heat's dynasty! Wade now officially way-past-his prime, Bosch, truly overrated,has disappeared NBA Finals, except moment brilliance game 2! forever goodbye Miami heat me, die-hard Lakers'fan planet! 
s<r386> Division foes always others numbers. Dallas won ship SA took 7. 
n<c387> Spurs respect game, love other, follow great coach. really "play game right way." make watching NBA game fun. Congrats deserving franchise. 
s<c389> (Full disclosure Cleveland think LeBron worm. However, hear point biased worm like actions...) 
s<r390> Rodman Worm. 
s<c391> Wow Erik Spolstra idea just happened. especially enjoyed inbounds play called timeout for, drew play Heat got second violation. 
s<r402> talked playing football. Queen LeBron play full pads heat September football even make past outdoor like basketball game?!? 
s<r407> Now true fan!! 
n<c409> anyone else disgusted seeming media bias win? every online media outlet posting victory FRONT PAGE, leading story? spurs class team outfit just "gets job done" something else behind lack respect best team NBA "sterling" silver debacle, "lebone going do" important? Oh well, spurs win again... dum de dum de dum,.... 
s<c414> Basketball way played. 
s<c416> Thanks Kelly great analysis. Spurs top notch longer time team can remember. Ginobili's dunk killer! Kawhi's award perfect recognition Spur's basketball. Next year? 
s<c420> Cavaliers suck oh wait mean Miami Heat. guess LeBron going come ANOTHER BIG Decision Summer. Sorry Heat fans going buy new team bandwagon around again. 
n<c421> Spurs consistent winners get good character guys trust coach, put egos side, drugs, bring guns locker room, pout whine benched, get along other, pass ball, trust system. called " San Antonio Way," teams want like them, high character guys work. words, knuckleheads team like Michael Beasley, lance Stephenson, J.R Rider. never, ever see guy like J.R. Rider Spurs. Stephen Jackson years ago, started become " unspurslike" whine, shipped 
n<c422> Russell Westbrook &amp; Kevin Durant (actually NBA teams), watch study SA Spurs learn team basketball. might much better chance winning playoffs. that, make basketball fun watch again. Thank Spurs great series! Sad see Tim, Tony &amp; Manu nearing retirement.... perhaps team ball might last longer usual. 
n<c427> LeBron never CONSISTENT leader since went Miami. Though tonight poor example it, come blazing, just sustain killer instinct. Much time, team down, will wait game already hand/decided pick quarter turn on, building stats up, everyone can say "LeBron part". Finals completely disappeared 4th quarters. Finals looked great. last year started look similar again, Ray Allen bailed team out. Now year, exception tonight, highest effort level always little late. post-game press conferences, just looks like matter much. 
n<c437> Congratulations San Antonio Spurs winning NBA Finals! Cheers Warriors fan. 
n<c438> San Antonio downs Miami Heat Game 5, wins 2013-14 NBA championship. 
n<c444> Spurs champions fact! remember last year negative comments called heat fans wonder now? 
n<c445> Four straight finals appearances two titles nothing Miami ashamed of. Congrats Spurs great year. 
s<r446> titles fluke 
s<r448> looked like bricks strapped ankles 
s<c450> write LBJ's teammates quitting him... maybe LBJ can know feels like, since teammates playoffs Cleveland several years ago. 
s<c456> Dallas Mavericks took Spurs 7th game 1st round. Makes realize bad East really is. Adam Silver realizes it. Picks 1,2,3 upcoming draft Eastern Conference teams.. 
n<c460> uhh, powerhouse big heat have. showed entire series, rather entire beat down. Shoot, name Lakers put fight Heat. completely embarrassing. LeBron will try get Spurs. 
s<c466> Spurs deserve year!! honestly cheering team long Miami take it. GET LEFLOP THERE!!! 
s<c467> NHL finals, OT games, shutout another goal game. NBA finals, blow outs, NHL NBA 
s<c470> Miami needed try harder. 
n<c472> LeBron amazing player, Spurs better TEAM. that, made difference. 
n<c474> heat fan, want congratulate spurs. knew going difficult final clearly better team won. bittersweet moment right adjustment team needs see finals. congrats spurs! 
s<c477> addition everyone else saying, like add Patty Mills saved Spurs several occasions, far getting funk, starting rallies. Everyone show Patty little love. know contract situation is, sure hope let get away. guy infectious. 
s<c479> San Antonio Spurs: humble gentlemen play minds crazy good. Miami Heat: over-rated thugs led man nearly good thinks is. Lebron James Bye. championships already won will get career. no, belong breath Magic Johnson, Abdul-Jabbar, Larry Bird, David Robinson, Hakeem Olajuwon, Michael Jordan. Jordan much better good college player. Forget ever mentioned sentence Jordan, Magic, Bird. Ain't ever gonna happen. 
s<r483> Birdman, thug happen know well, might rough around edges good person. stated Bird changes nothing, keep race baiting makes like loser. 
s<r485> one professional sports writer , ever announced lebitch g o t. one! legacy claiming fall back on? 
s<r488> @ Anthony...what "would have" happened big maybe experience..The G.O.A.T. debate fantasy conjecture. fact Lebron top player today, why? led team two consecutive victories...Kobe Bryant today. Melo good two, get credit leads team ring. 
s<r490> ? Thats oxymoron ever heard one. DISLIKE NBA, like Spurs. implies avoid NBA possible, just happen watch NBA Spurs. OK, hope good ride bandwagon. 
s<r493> again, much respect given LeBron! Wade won LeBron showed up. team went get talent could. problem is, includes James, player just relies fact much talent. Obviously, talent will get far, match team plays together win! 
s<r494> lbj done leaving cleveland..he will again,because sleep thinking Michael jordan greater him..

s<r601> really gonna put blame James? series just show James made points, showed Miami lacked true bench. Michael Jordan best players team contributing. say Miami Heat. 
s<r602> Ed, mouth-breathing mongoloid, you? lie, water head showing. damn right Phil Jackson much better coach boy blunder Miami. Jordan also much better player Queen James. mad, bro? cry like boy LeBron? :'( LOL 
s<r604> Lupe, point. something water Miami? thought post quite clear fairly articulate (it late tired, though) message. adult read you. Preferably one speaks English. know, know...that's next impossible Miami.

s<r608> James = Jordan claim one significantly better worse kinda silly. 
s<r610> @Adam Oh Adam, love avoided question last comment Jordan telling teammates "to move way". probably even know defensive 3-second violation is. NBA greats like Scottie Pippen Hakeem Olajuwon saying LeBron nothing advantage team. Basketball team sport players heat show up. Stop trying hard buddy, Get comment thread go check wife more, probably cheating someone actually life LOL.
