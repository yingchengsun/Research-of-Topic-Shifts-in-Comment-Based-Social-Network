n*<r9>                        Lebron didn't play his heart out, that's why he sat out the last 5 minutes of the game sulking and feeling sorry for himself. Pathetic Lebron fans, want to give credit to him for what? Being a quitter and not being a good leader? He should've been on the floor with the rest of the starters trying to mount a come back even if they were down by 20 with 5 minutes to go. He has no heart!
s*<r12>                        @stop the lies, Jordan wouldn't have sat on the bench like that little baby. Jordan was the real deal, Lebron is still behind Kobe if you ask me.
s*<r14>                        @Ruiz:  Do you really think James wouldn't have been in the game if he wanted to be out there?  Spoelstra is the coach, but James is the franchise.  If James wants Spoelstra gone he's gone.  If Spoelstra wants James gone Spoelstra is gone.
s*<r17>                        Stop the Lies: Lebron individually and statistically absolutely killed the SAS. But it's a team sport. 
n*<r18>                        @Rulz  Lebron wasn't a factor in the second half of the last game. Past NBA legends always played harder in the second half where it most counted, not in the first quarter. But give SAS credit, they shut him down in the second half but it's not a surprise since Lebron has a habit of fading towards the end of important games when the defense zero's in on him and his limited moves doesn't help.
s<c19>                    Yeah the rest of the league can take notes from this championship team. Nowadays the focus is on star power and BIG front office trades/signings when all you really need is teamwork and developing your players. Kawahi was traded for George Hill to be a role player and now look at him. Danny Green would have won the Finals MVP last year and neither of them are getting 20 million a year. This is the right direction for the league. Good job Spurs!
n<c25>                    I found the owner's comment about the team and America to be a bit funny considering the international flavor of the Spurs.  They are a great team and a great champion!  Congratulations.  No reason to think they can't do it again next year if everybody comes back.  This year they seemed to stay reasonably healthy.  If they can do that and Pop does his excellent job of managing time, I see no reason for them not to repeat.  I am a Lakers fan for a long time but, it was fun to watch the Spurs win another one for 'Cow Town'!  lol!  ; p
n<c26>                    The Spurs have so much love and respect for one another. They all want each other to succeed. Nobody wants to be top dog to outshine anyone else. One of the reasons that they are so great is because they care more about their team mates than themselves. Unselfish, classy players with a great "Pop" to thank for it. Love the Spurs and am so proud of them. I'm also so happy that Kawhi got MVP. He was amazing. Love my Spurs!!!
n*<r27>                        Ditto Cassandra...I will miss watching the games every week!
n<c28>                    Team playing is why they won. Lebron and his team looked weak and tired, just didn't have the mustard.  Wade and Duncan are at the end of their careers so will see how both teams make adjustments next year and we can do this all over again.  I didn't see a MJ on the court the last two games, did you? I didn't even see a MVP on the court except for Tim Duncan and his two guards which played the game perfectly.  Two really bad games and the HEAT should be 110% ashamed.... Never say we are going to WIN and then get beat by 20ish "Bosh". Next year it will be the WARRIORS turn to win the big one.
s*<r30>                        The thing is that Wade is only 32 Timmy is 38,   large difference in basket ball years.  TImmy however has never played with injuries nor a lot of minutes.  That is why TImmy is still viable because he has been well preserved.
s*<r34>                        I'll take money and two rings.
s*<r39>                        I also hope Jerry took note, but we all know he did not!
s*<r50>                        Malone was much more talented, but I'm a biased Jazz fan.  :p
n*<r51>                        I'm a laker fan and a Kobe fan but I don't really mind if Duncan will win again the next 2 or 3 championships. Spurs reminded us that basketball is a TEAM sport. =)
s*<r54>                        not to take anything away from duncan but he was the best power forward on one of the best run teams of the 90s and 2000s....duncans a beast but the team aspect in s.a. is what made duncan who he is....thats why hes so good cause he thought of his team first not his own stats......many power forwards could hang with duncan skillwise but not many have the team attitude duncan has
s*<r58>                        Laker fan, yes I am, but I will stand by my premise.  I'm not saying he's an offensive machine, but he did have a FG % over .500.  Personally, I believe Noah is playing out of position, he should be a PF instead of C.
s*<r61>                        John's team's biggest weakness is at center, and his forwards are not as strong.  Guard play would be interesting since Magic and Oscar would be a great duel and Kobe vs. Jordan with both in their prime would be epic, but I believe the difference would be down low.  I was tempted to put Pistol Pete as my shooting guard but I like the Jordan-Bryant match-up.
s<c63>                    We all forget, that had Ray Allen missed that Game 6 3-pointer last year, the Heat would have lost to the Spurs...they went to 7 games last year and nearly lost it.  The Heat are NOT the better team, they won thanks to a lucky (and desperate shot).  The win over the Thunder two years ago was legit, although they won thanks to LeBron and Wade flopping on just about every possession and cheap fouls were called against the Thunder.
n*<r64>                        Mauricio is right, gthe Spurs were the better team last year too. They just blew it. They made the Heat pay for it this year with arguably the most dominating finals series ever.
s<r72>                        ROLE!
s<r73>                        LB will soon get a new name called Lebeg.  He is going to beg for another superstar like Cameltlow to join his team to make an all stars team to win another title in the NBA.  Kawhi is the Lebeg and Wade killer.  He will continue be on lebeg's mind haunted.  Thanks you Kawhi and spurs players for shutting down the annoying sounds from the Miami for this summer.  They swept the cats in 1st round, they beat the Nets 2nd, they went through the Pacers in the 3rd and then they got their wheels broken while running to Texas.  We also remember the Lebeg said he wanted the Spurs in the finals because he and the heat have not cried for the past 2 years.
s<r75>                        OMG! is this real a player without tatoos i.e. Kawhi?
n<r76>                        Kawhi's humbleness make him a perfect fit w/ the Spurs.  That kid became a superstar over the last week or so.
n<c82>                    First, let me say I mean no disrespect at all to Tony Gwynn or his family, and I  believe he was one of the best players/hitters of all time.  However, the Heat couldn't have asked for a better situation right now.  They were just utterly humiliated in the NBA Finals by a far superior team (that also should have beaten them last year).  All the hype Lebron and the LeBron-ettes get from those with their heads up LeBron's kester and the sports media (ESPN) is built on a foundation of sand. No one in the above LeBron fan club likes to talk when LeBron loses, but you can't get it off your TV when he wins.  Now the fan club has an excuse not to talk about the Heat's epic failure.   But I promise you that Gwynn's death would not be the lead story if it was the Heat who just won in 5.  LeBron may be the best in the game today, but continues to show why he is far from the best all-time.  He had arguably the same if not more to work with on his team than Jordan, and Jordan had far, far more success.  People say there are too many LeBron haters (and I may be considered in that category).  However, it's not hating when you point out the facts.  One of those facts is he ain't all that he's cracked up to be - and there's far too much to back that up than I can list here.  But most of all, being blown away in 4 of 5 proves it.  He's just lucky they weren't swept - because he came close to that.
n<c86>                    Lakers fan, here. I'm biased in favor of the west, but I say the following without bias. I truly enjoy watching and cheering for the Spurs. Their like a great old-school high school team that does everything right. I'm happy for every player on that team and Pops and the staff. Congrats to San Antonio.
n<r88>                        Actually, I finally saw some  concession from the media tonight.  There was more lauding of the Spurs' team play than talk of LeBron for once.  Of course, it didn't stop them from referring to LeBron as the best player in the world (truly annoying), but they did finally give the Spurs their due.
s<r109>                        I would take the Mav's over the Heat in the best of seven. MAV's, OKC, Clippers would all best them.
n<r110>                        First of all...GO MAVS! Second, glad the heat didn't win. Respect for the spurs, they BUILT a team and didn't buy their way in. Also, gotta figure miami's having nightmares about now, 2 TEXAS teams built through hard work that handed them their #$%$ in under a 4 year period. Guess NBA 2014 still had some-what of a happy ending. "Anyone but the heat" indeed.
s<r114>                        And the Spurs will be waiting!
s<r115>                        Bring it on, baby!  We'll be ready! :)
s<r121>                        I'm a Jazz fan. Hope we win one game against the Spurs next year.
s<r123>                        Based on history...the Heat did put team before self the past 2 seasons, right?
n<r137>                        JDB, your comments are spot on.  What the Spurs have as an organization and as players is hard to quantify.  I was watching tonight as David Robinson, Sean Elliot, Avery Johnson, and Bruce Bowen were on the floor with the team, celebrating another championship.  Robinson was interviewed and said it best.  Once you have been a part of the Spurs, you are "family," and you always remain part of the family.  We may never see another group like this in our lifetime, as times have changed.  I'm just going to sit back with you, and savor the moment.  Go Spurs Go!
n<c145>                    Congratulations to the San Antonio Spurs. I live here and the city has erupted. Military drive is on fire! Could not have happened to a better bunch of guys. love this team. Watching Timmy get emotional was a tear jerker.
s<r147>                        they wont win another one in a while, they have won alot which is good but it will be a few before they win again, trust me, the West isnt going to let them get their 3 years in a row!
s<r148>                        You have pipe dreams.
n<c150>                    As a Heat fan I congratulate the Spurs in a job well done. I really felt Spoelstra was out coached. The Spurs players listened to their coach and they went out and did it. The big three for the Spurs have been together for a long time and know how to stick together. The Heat big three have been together for 4 years now and we're still learning. We've all learned how to handle the hate and the criticism to the point where it doesn't matter and just go about our business of trying to win a championship. The lost to the Mavericks hurt but this time around not so much but a big thank you for a great season. As for Carmelo Anthony I don't want it to happen and it shouldn't happen. Sign or draft young defensive minded guys and bring big blue collar guys in with size. Have fun Spurs fan because we did last year. Enjoy it and cheers. I will see all you NBA fans next season. Good night.
n<r154>                        Jay... I'm glad that you give credit to the Spurs for the win, but I really would not fault Spolstra.  It just seemed obvious to me that the Spurs wanted it more.  They were feeding off of the loss from last year while the Heat seemed to be on autopilot.
s<r157>                        The heat were not after wins, they !!!!! Were!!!!!! after culture, 
n<r160>                        I'm a Heat fan myself as well, and this time even I feel that the Spurs proved to be the better team. Plus I'm also glad to see that LeBron showed better sportsmanship in congratulating his opponents on their win, unlike the first time he went to the Finals as a Heat player and just walked off the court in shame after losing to the Mavs, that was just ill.
s<r168>                        I noticed that too. This was all the Spurs moments, not LeBron's. I got the feeling he did not want the camera on him as he walked.
s<r171>                        What are some of these words you got going here, yup , hoopra, grandeur, and palate, what do they mean  ???
s<r172>                        It hurt my brain to read. Spurs fan here, but no reason to hate on LeBron, he is a class act as well. Maybe a little over confident at times, but his play backs up his mouth. It is his team who could not help him.
s<r176>                        Bulls fan here.  I tend to agree with you.
s<r182>                        What is your issue with the salary cap?
n<c184>                    The Spurs won. I am happy for some reason. Probably because this might be the last time we see a team that was coached the right way. I love the way that they played. As a wonderful team. And that western conference is so competitive it makes it hard to imagine that they made the playoffs every year since 1999. Even when the Lakers missed out on playoffs. This team was perfectly coached and won as a classic team. They played basketball like it is suppose to played and we might not ever see a team like this again. Congrats to the San Antonio Spurs.
n<r191>                        I agree 100% with all of the above.  An interesting note:  As mighty as Miami was supposed to be, the TrailBlazers actually had a smaller total point spread margin than Miami  (Portland lost their series with the Spurs by 3 points less than Miami).
s<r193>                        That kind of team may not end after all the Spurs have assistant coach spread around the league growing new teams in that style hopefully to save the NBA from turning into a scripted Hollywood movie.
s<r197>                        Ronald go back to your gaybar boy
s<r200>                        ...it was a team sport the last two years too!...LOL!
s<c203>                    Marvelous basketball. Best TEAM basketball I've ever seen in 50 years of watching.
s<c210>                    Coming this summer:  The Decision, Part II
s<r211>                        LeBron took his talents to South Beach....the Spurs take their talent EVERYWHERE.....
n<r215>                        They lost since they are old.  San Antonio won and they are old!
s<r217>                        Don't forget tony is only 32, Wade is an OLD 32 and Bosh is only 29 as well as Lebron, but the rest of the team Lewis 35, Allan 38, Birdman 35, THAT is an OLD team.
s<r220>                        Greg, how many finals have u played in? How many teams have u coached?  Exactly. Shut up u loser.
s<r224>                        No, it was on ESPN news 'cause of the US Open Golf.......lame move....
n<r227>                        Last night before the game started he was on Sportscenter and predicted a win by the Spurs.
s<c229>                    I LOVE THE SPURS!!  They are dedicated, humble, articulate, and they genuinely love their coach. I despise LeBron James and everything the represents. So glad he got served!!
s<r230>                        I don't despise Lebron, but Tim Duncan exhibits nothing but class and professionalism. Makes it easy to root for him.  Glad he has one for the thumb now.
n<c232>                    And the Spurs are the Champions, many congratulations to the Spurs Players, Pop, Owner and the Fans.
n<c235>                    Congrats, Spurs!!!  It's not often a team wins an NBA title on PURE intelligence.  Mind you, of ALL the great things the Heat ARE, intelligent won't make the list.
s<c236>                    Can the debate end here this is a dynasty, and one that only is shining brighter today, like the Celtics, Lakers and Bulls this is the best basketball team of their time period.
n<c238>                    San Antonio Spurs left no doubt who was the better team of this series. Way to go SPURS
s<c244>                    If the NBA would just realize what a pleasure it is to watch real basketball and get away from trying to generate the next mega superstar it would be such a better league. Take notice NBA, real bball fans want real bball, congrats spurs!
n<r246>                        Exactly !! I have never watched much NBA at all, some of the playoffs and the finals...but this series has got my attention !! I am actually looking forward to watching the NBA next season ( who knows...maybe the Hornets will step up and play some " Team " ball like the Spurs did this year ! )
s<r252>                        really how so?  WHen has Kobe done anything but whine.  WOuld he take 10 million less a year to keep his team together?   Timmy, Tony and Manu did.
s<c256>                    Michael Jordan and his Chicago Bulls never cast a longer shadow than they do now.  It was fashionable to compare the Heat to that legendary bulls team, but when you consider that last years finals should have been SA's and this year's beat down of the Heat, that discussion is passe.
s<r259>                        I thought he put up 50 tonight but i guess he was too tired. Or just lacking that fire, heart. The stubbornness Jordan, Pippen, Kobe have.
n<r264>                        His partners, DWade and Bosh, have gotten old all of a sudden. LeBron is the best on the planet, just like Jordan was, and he has developed a level of trust that wasn't there since the Dallas Finals. It's not a man game, but a team game, trouble is, the rest of the Heat were no-shows.
s<r266>                        I'm just glad we didn't have to see or hear that stupid Sir Charles in this series, he SUX!
s<c268>                    Don't know if I heard it wrong but in the pregame telecast last night one of the announcers said the Heat needed to go out and get physical, throw some elbows, etc. because it's the only way they can win.  I was shocked.  I was in the kitchen when I heard this and when I came out they had cut to commercial so I don't know who said it.  Did anyone else hear something to that effect last night?
n<c273>                    TEAM BASKETBALL:  great fun to watch in action.  The better team prevailed over the overhyped stars.
n<c275>                    Teams usually beat talented individuals.
s<c278>                    Its always cool to watch a fundamentally sound team shred another.
s<c286>                    Love how Leonard never gets upset or makes faces on ref calls...never.  He seems like a man playing boys and beating them while they continue to make faces, complain etc.  Was fun to watch.
s<c289>                    I'm just glad basketball season is over. We're nearly at the All-Star break in baseball.
n<c290>                    Like I said in my previous comments; The Spurs had "Weapons of Destruction" and if they kept up their tempo they were going to destroy the Heat and they did (with Team Empowerment). LeBron was just a one man team. It's Over - Lets go to other Sports that's going on (Soccer?). Have a Nice Day.
s<r298>                        Then record wise the top three teams would have only qualified under the West.      Heat lacked any real challenge until got to the West in the finals.
n<c305>                    I want to apologize to Manu Ginobli. When the Spurs brought him back for the amount of money he got paid for I was a bit livid. I figure he was done and that he has a reckless type of play (like JR Smith/Westbrook) to take shots when he doesn't need to.  But after watching the playoffs.. the three to tie it up with OKC.. and his play in the finals I owe him a huge apology.  He really stepped up. The entire team stepped up. Congratulations to the Spurs and now Popovich can go on vacation.. because last year he said he didn't because of the Finals loss
s<c306>                    This Spurs team was basketball personified.
s<r318>                        I so agree, Brian. It's like they're trying to convince us he's the best player
s<r319>                        Only all of the NBA coaches, players and pundits (who aren't haters) credit Lebron for being the best player in the game today. But I guess you and Brian know more about basketball than they do Isabella.
s<r320>                        "trying to convince us he's the best player" - what a fool. Every knowledgable basketball man and player syas without hesitation he is the best player, and not even close. Because you have an issue with hating a guy and can't see the truth, does not make it the mdeia's issue. I never liked (still don't) Jordan, but he was the best of his era no matter how much I did not like him.
n<c324>                    The Miami Heat don't have a legitimate big man or a point guard even close to a Tony Parker or Chris Paul. So, they were built to use the 3-point shot to their advantage. Unfortunately, they lost their shooting touch in the finals. Check the numbers. They were not hitting those 3s as they did previously in the playoffs. That was the story. Yes, San Antonio played basketball the way it was meant to be played and their bench were out of this world, but the Heat did get decent looks, but they didn't go in this time around. Spoelstra, being a protege of Riley, suffered what Riley suffered with the Knicks and the Heat prior to the big three. They refuse to allow bench players to play and grow during the season so they would be ready for the playoffs. They continually overuse the starting five and that cost them this year. I pray we make some moves even though there are no big men available, but a point guard with a serious handle would be a huge plus. No need to clean house, but if we could trade Bosh in order to get a center/power forward, that would be great. I don't think, however, that Bosh would command any attention. Hey, maybe Pau Gasol would like to come here!!!! That would be huge!!!! We are proud of our Miami Heat and the excitement of the last 4 years. Now, we just need to get a couple of players to help us or see what we have on the bench and actually let them play!!!!
s<r325>                        cheat heat need to clean house and start over D Wade is shot out, bosh thinks defense is a tabu, chalmers and allen need to understand that Lebron is the only one that can get away with using the elbow
n<c326>                    Congratulations to the Spurs for a very dominant, impressive NBA final.
s<r328>                        And a classy post John.
s<c330>                    The amazing work Greg Popovich continues to do year after year with a number of various "no-name" players is amazing, and undeniable. His system emphasizes team play like no other head coach I've ever seen. He seriously has to be considered for best all time.
n<c343>                    I said it here a couple days ago after win three, the Spurs are playing basketball as well as I have ever seen it played in this series, the passing, the finding the open man, getting the ball to the hot hand, the aggressive defense, did I mention the defense?  I grew up watching the great Laker teams playing the great Celtics, then the Bad Boys from Detroit, then the Michael and the Bulls, they were all great, but I don't know if I have EVER seen better team ball than the Spurs in this series.
n<r346>                        I haven't. Good comparisons, but they didn't move the ball like the Spurs.
s<c353>                    I'm not sure I've ever seen Timmy smile so much!  Great to see that Dave, Sean and Avery were there to celebrate with Pop and the team.
n<c360>                    Kawhi definitely earned the MVP. He showed up big in these last 3 games and proved to be a major factor in the Spurs play. The commentators kept saying he looked like a star every time he pulled up for a shot. He was never rattled and showed that he's the future of the franchise.
s<r364>                        sad thing isthe cheat heat fans will never get it they were dismantled
s<c369>                    Michael Jordan made everyone better around him. Those questioning who is better on the Lebron vs MJ debate are holding their heads down in shame for doubting 23 for even a second.
n<r375>                        this year proved that the Spurs gave it away last year
n<c376>                    The spurs are a team. The heat is a collection of players.
n<c382>                    The Miami heat not only lost this 2014 NBA FINALS, but the way they lost their last three games have forever exposed their huge defensive liability! Their system is broken, and there is no remedy! Their arrogance of proclaiming to the world that they will win not "one,.., not two,.., not three,.., not six,.." has being forever pulverized!The much vaunted big three is in big disarray, now that the Spurs have annihilated them in this 2014 NBA FINALS!I watched a snippet of game 5, to pay my homages to the end of the very short-lived Miami Heat's dynasty! Wade is now officially way-past-his prime, while Bosch, who is truly overrated,has disappeared in this NBA Finals, except for a few moment of brilliance in game 2! This is a forever goodbye to the Miami heat from me, the most die-hard Lakers'fan on the planet!
s<r386>                        Division foes always have each others numbers.  When Dallas won the ship SA took them to 7.
n<c387>                    The Spurs respect the game, love each other, and follow a great coach. They really do "play the game the right way." They make watching the NBA game fun. Congrats to a very deserving franchise.
s<c389>                    (Full disclosure - I'm from Cleveland and I think LeBron is a worm.  However, hear me out - I have a point that isn't biased by his worm like actions...)
s<r390>                        Rodman is the Worm.
s<c391>                    Wow Erik Spolstra has no idea what just happened.   I especially enjoyed the inbounds play that he called a timeout for, drew up the play and then the Heat got a 5 second violation.
s<r402>                        They talked about him playing football. How could Queen LeBron play with full pads in the heat of September football if he couldn't even make it past an outdoor like basketball game?!?
s<r407>                        Now here's a true fan!!
n<c409>                    Is anyone else as disgusted as I for the seeming media bias on this win?  Why isn't every online media outlet posting this victory as the FRONT PAGE, leading story?  Is it because the spurs are a class team outfit that just "gets the job done" or is there something else behind this lack of respect for the best team in the NBA while the "sterling" silver debacle, and what is "lebone going to do" more important?  Oh well, spurs win again... dum de dum de dum,....
s<c414>                    Basketball the way it should be played.
s<c416>                    Thanks Kelly for the great analysis. Spurs are top notch and have been for a longer time than any other team I can remember. Ginobili's dunk was killer! Kawhi's award is a perfect recognition of Spur's basketball. Next year?
s<c420>                    The Cavaliers suck oh wait I mean the Miami Heat.  I guess LeBron is going to come out with ANOTHER BIG Decision this Summer.  Sorry Heat fans your going to have to buy a new team to bandwagon around again.
n<c421>                    The Spurs are consistent winners because they get good character guys who trust their coach, put their egos on the side, don't do drugs, don't bring guns to the locker room, don't pout and whine if they're benched, get along with each other, pass the ball, and trust their system. It's called " The San Antonio Way," and other teams want to be like them, but you have to have high character guys for it to work. In other words, you can't have knuckleheads on your team like Michael Beasley, lance Stephenson, or J.R Rider. You would never, ever see a guy like J.R. Rider on the Spurs. They had Stephen Jackson a few years ago, and when he started to become " unspurslike" and whine, they shipped him off
n<c422>                    Russell Westbrook &amp; Kevin Durant (actually to ALL NBA teams), watch and study the SA Spurs and learn team basketball.  Then you might have a much better chance at winning in the playoffs.  Not only that, you'll make basketball fun to watch again.  Thank you Spurs for a great series!  Sad to see Tim, Tony &amp; Manu nearing retirement.... but perhaps with team ball they might last longer than usual.
n<c427>                    LeBron has never been a CONSISTENT leader since he went to Miami.  Though tonight is a poor example of it, because he did come out blazing, he just cannot sustain the killer instinct.  Much of the time, when his team is down, he will wait until the game is already out of hand/decided and THEN pick a quarter or so to turn it on, building his stats up, so that everyone can say "LeBron did his part".  In the 2011 Finals he completely disappeared in the 4th quarters.  In the 2012 Finals he looked great.  Then last year he started to look similar to 2011 again, before Ray Allen bailed the team out.  Now this year, with the exception of tonight, his highest effort level was always a little too late.  During the post-game press conferences, he just looks like it doesn't matter that much.
n<c437>                    Congratulations San Antonio Spurs for winning the NBA Finals!  Cheers from a Warriors fan.
n<c438>                    San Antonio downs the Miami Heat in Game 5, wins the 2013-14 NBA championship. 
n<c444>                    Spurs are the champions that is a fact! I remember last year there were negative comments from so called heat fans I wonder where they are now?
n<c445>                    Four straight finals appearances and two titles is nothing for Miami to be ashamed of.  Congrats to the Spurs on a great year.
s<r446>                        1 of those titles was a fluke
s<r448>                        It looked like he had bricks strapped to his ankles
s<c450>                    For those who write about LBJ's teammates quitting on him...  maybe LBJ can know what it feels like, since he did that to his teammates in the playoffs in Cleveland several years ago.
s<c456>                    The Dallas Mavericks took the Spurs to a 7th game in the 1st round. Makes you realize how bad the East really is. Adam Silver realizes it. Picks 1,2,3 and 4 in the upcoming draft - all to Eastern Conference teams..
n<c460>                    So uhh, where is the powerhouse of the big 3 that the heat have. Only 1 showed up the entire series, or rather the entire beat down. Shoot, the no name Lakers would have put up more of a fight than the Heat. That was completely embarrassing. LeBron will not try to get on the Spurs.
s<c466>                    The Spurs deserve it all this year!! But honestly I was cheering for ANY team as long as Miami did not take it. GET LEFLOP OUT OF THERE!!!
s<c467>                    NHL finals, 3 OT games, a shutout and another 1 goal game.  NBA finals, 4 blow outs, NHL NBA
s<c470>                    Miami needed to try harder.
n<c472>                    LeBron is an amazing player, but the Spurs are the better TEAM. And that, that has made all the difference.
n<c474>                    As a heat fan, I want to congratulate the spurs. I knew this was going to be a difficult final and clearly the better team won. It's a bittersweet moment but with the right adjustment that my team needs I could see them again in the finals. Again congrats spurs!
s<c477>                    In addition to what everyone else is saying, I would like to add that Patty Mills saved the Spurs on several occasions, as far as getting them out of a funk, and starting rallies. Everyone should show Patty a little love.  I don't know what his contract situation is, but I sure hope they don't let him get away.  This guy is infectious.
s<c479>                    San Antonio Spurs:  humble gentlemen that play out of their minds crazy good.  Miami Heat:  over-rated thugs led by a man who is not nearly as good as he thinks he is.  Lebron James Bye.  the championships you already won will be all that you get in your career.  And no, you do not belong in the same breath as Magic Johnson, Abdul-Jabbar, Larry Bird, David Robinson, Hakeem Olajuwon, Michael Jordan.   Jordan is as much better than you as you are above some good college player.  Forget ever being mentioned in the same sentence with Jordan, Magic, Bird.  Ain't ever gonna happen.
s<r483>                        Birdman, isn't a thug I happen to know him very well, he might be rough around the edges but he's a good person. You stated Bird changes nothing, keep race baiting makes you like a loser.
s<r485>                        not one professional sports writer , has ever announced that lebitch is the g o a t.  Not one! what legacy are you claiming that he has too fall back on?
s<r488>                        @ Anthony...what "would have" happened is a big maybe experience..The G.O.A.T. debate is all fantasy and conjecture. The fact is that Lebron is the top player today, why? He led his team to two consecutive victories...Kobe Bryant can't do that today. Melo is good as any of the two, but he can't get his credit until he leads a team to the ring. 
s<r490>                        ? Thats an oxymoron if I ever heard one. I DISLIKE NBA, but like the Spurs. That implies you avoid any NBA at all possible, but you just happen to watch the NBA for the Spurs. OK, hope you had a good ride on the bandwagon.
s<r493>                        Once again, too much respect is given to LeBron!  Wade won before LeBron showed up.  That team then went on to get all the talent they could.  The problem is, and this includes James,  that each player just relies on the fact that they have so much talent.  Obviously, that talent will get you far, but it's no match for a team that plays together to win!
s<r494>                        lbj has done it before leaving cleveland..he will do it again,because he can't sleep thinking that Michael jordan is greater than him..
s<c497>                    Who would win if the 13-14 San Antonio Spurs and the 95-96 Chicago Bulls played in a 7 game series?
s<c498>                    The NBA.
s<r499>                        like lebron
n<r504>                        If you call the Spurs of 2013-14 boring you know absolutely nothing about the true game of basketball.  The name of the game is to score Spurs averaged about 105 points per game, and to stop the other team from scoring Spurs gave up like 96 points per game. They won 62 regular season games and didn't have one player average over 17 points per game.  Sorry man but that isn't boring that is how the game is supposed to be played.  If you need all of that streetball hanging on the rim and celebrating every shot made like you have never made one before you need to buy an And1  tape.
s<c505>                    The rest of the NBA watching community gets it....why doesnt the media see that fans are tired of excuse making divas and superheroes and just wanna see back to basics and fundamentals basketball by classy teams like the Spurs? Even Miami fans feels the better TEAM won!
s<c507>                    I liked that they are both outfitted by Adidas.
s<c508>                    I congratulate the Spurs on an impressive series win, but damn, I love NBA basketball so much I just wish the series could have gone seven games.
s<c511>                    Man, 3 wins in Miami to take the title. I never would've expected them to win every game in Miami when I don't think the Heat lost a home game all post season.
s<c532>                    Will be interesting to see were James ends up. Won't be with the Heat.
n<c534>                    A very good Spurs team crushed the Heat.
s<r537>                        Miami could  not count of their bench, unlike the Spurs. Of which I a glad! Not sure I agree with this (Miami) Carmelo talk.
s<c543>                    Bosh:
n<c544>                    After the self-promoting fanfare with which James went to Miami and their self-declared status as the best, it gives me pleasure to see them get beaten by a team that plays together instead of in support of a few individuals.
s<r551>                        Dark thread .   Sounds like democrat jackass combined with Ebonics .
s<r554>                        Keith, Wilt was a giant among boys, He could score at will. He was also 7'1".
n<c556>                    Hell to the mutherfudging Yeah ...thank you spurs.. I had hope though the first quarter was a slow start but when it ended I knew the spurs were nt giving up that easy.. ha good game... just shows that to truly win an nba title you need teamwork not individual work...spurs are just too good.. sorry Miami not this time.. it's about time we got that 5
s<r565>                        Agree. I hate Kobe, but he's closer to what Jordan was than LBJ.
n<r572>                        Nice job Spurs and u have the best coach in the league
s<r577>                        Jordan shot for 38 points in the flu game.
n<c582>                    Beautiful, just beautiful!!!!  In the age of the individualism, a TEAM wins again.  The Spurs exemplify the example of TEAM!!!!  Dallas was the last TEAM to win as a TEAM and beat the vaulted Heat the first time around!  But the Spurs will go down as the TEAM that ended this reign of individuals.  Congrats to The Spurs TEAM for winning this championship!!!!!
s<r585>                        Semper Fi Marine
n<c588>                    Quit knocking Miami for some perceived wrong, they just got beat by a better TEAM. I know nobody on the Spurs will have an exciting "decision" show or feels the need to dress like some pretentious CEO or make sure they are giving exciting interviews to ensure they are in the spotlight or won't be throwing powder in the air like some kind of WWE intro but they can darn sure play the TEAM game of basketball. It's amazing what a bunch of blue collar, no nonsense, no drama, no frills workers can do. I guess some guys just want attention and others just want to win.
n<c589>                    finally in the spur of the moment a monumental win of the San Antonio Spurs - 2014 champion again for the 5th time. and with big margin. Miami Heat undeniably a great team are denied of their 3peat and dynasty dream should they won. not this time. both are great teams that owners should be proud of. congratulations to the Spur. so too the Miami Heat.
s<c590>                    After seeing this series, I no longer believe LeBron threw away the finals when he played for the Cavaliers. He certainly threw away this series with his and his team's tepid playing, which deserves renaming the team the "Miami Frostbite."
s<r601>                        Are you really gonna put the blame on James? This series didn't just show you that James made all the points, but it showed you that Miami lacked a true bench. Michael Jordan was the best because he had all 15 players on the team contributing. You can't say the same for the Miami Heat.
s<r602>                        Ed, you're a mouth-breathing mongoloid, aren't you? Don't lie, your water head is showing. You're damn right Phil Jackson is a much better coach than the boy blunder in Miami. Jordan was also a much better player than Queen James. You mad, bro? Why don't you cry about it like your boy LeBron? :'( LOL
s<r604>                        Lupe, that was my point. Is there something in the water down there in Miami? I thought my post was quite clear and fairly articulate (it is late and I'm tired, though) in its message. Have an adult read it to you. Preferably one who speaks English. I know, I know...that's next to impossible in Miami.
s<r605>                        Jordan is the GOAT. A competitor that was relentless and NEVER gave up. End of story.
s<r608>                        James = Jordan to claim one is significantly better or worse is kinda silly. 
s<r610>                        @Adam Oh Adam, I love how you avoided the question in my last comment about Jordan telling his teammates "to move out of the way". You probably don't even know what a defensive 3-second violation is. There are NBA greats like Scottie Pippen and Hakeem Olajuwon saying that LeBron is nothing but an advantage to any team. Basketball is a team sport and the other 14 players on the heat didn't show up. Stop trying too hard buddy, Get off this comment thread and go check in on your wife more, she's probably cheating on you with someone who actually has a life LOL.
s<r616>                        You can't compare LBJ to Jordan, everybody in the world knows that!  It's all agreed that if Lebron goes to the 76's, they become a championship contender....why is that?  O it's because LeBron doesn't make his team better?, wow their are some LBJ haters out there!!
s<r622>                        I got you guys lol, it's just seeing a throwback to those eras. I remember all that, I'm 50. just got caught up in the moment,  that we saw basketball played by a team the way we haven't seen it played in a Finals in a LONG time.
s<r623>                        "F" the cheatin +ss Spurs
s<r626>                        Bulls `96 record 72-10......not hating but numbers never lie!!
n<c635>                    Lebron is not the best player in the world. He doesn't have the killer instinct like Jordan or Kobe who take teams on their backs will their way to victory. Miami better get some size otherwise they will end up get bounced for playoffs next year. And as far as the Spurs what can you say they have a great team all around and that's why they beat Miami. I still say they lucked out by Ibaka from the Thunder.not being there the first two games in that series against the Spurs
s<r637>                        Jordan willed wins....which rallied his team behind him. Lebron....is too much of a ME ME ME player.
s<r641>                        @ Nobody, Jordan was good but he never put the bulls on his back and carried them to a championship, I am in my mid fifties and have only seen  two players do that, the first was Bill Walton in both of his championships with the Blazers and the other was Olajawon's last ring with the Rockets.
s<c642>                    Score one more for the good guys who just play basketball without all the hoopla and drama. The Heat is cooked.
s<c643>                    Stern commissioner:  Spurs lose questionable games off of questionable calls and questionable coaching decisions
s<r645>                        shady things have been happening ever since 1984, Sterns first year as commissioner and ironically, Michael Jordan's draft year.
s<r646>                        @Paul, I'm outside of Miami and not really a Boston fan either, just like fair play. I recall vividly the calls that handed Miami the Eastern Division in 2012. They couldn't beat Boston for it, so the commissioner gave it to them through the errant calls.
n<c653>                    God, Duncan, Pop and Manu shouldn't retire. They've still got it, and maybe they could be the ones 3-peating!!! Leonard is calm, cool and collected and outplayed LeBron on both sides of the ball this series. Very deserving of the MVP award. I loved seeing Duncan holding his kids on Father's Day after winning it. Beautiful moment.
s<r655>                        lame
n<r661>                        The Spurs are the most fundamental team in basketball and they're old/young they have the 2 best young guys in Green and Leonard who will be the Finals MVP and the Heat couldn't compete w/ that and got obliterated this year but there's no reason to diss them, hats off to the Heat but the better team won this year, congrats to the Spurs
s<r667>                        GINOBLI! Nice dunk! Old white guys can jump!
s<c669>                    I am surprised by this usually the refs make sure Miami wins.
s<r673>                        Doubt it.  If anything this guy is hopefully another Tim Duncan.
s<r676>                        @Charles
s<r677>                        He won't. He (Kawhi) came of out of nowhere, unlike LeBron.
s<r689>                        The bashers aren't Spurs fans they are haters
s<r692>                        Its called celebrating.  Not even close to what Miami fans did last year.
s<c703>                    I completely hate basketball, but man, what a true team. This is what a pro team should be, and act like. Tim Duncan is the MAN good for you San Antonio. Now my Vikes need to do something. Que the haters.
s<c704>                    The NBA needs more International players if we want to continue to see team work.
s<c726>                    This was what you call a good ole fashion BUTT KICKING! Miami were boys among men.
s<r730>                        I don't think Cleveland wants a buffoon such as James anymore. They've probably learned that they are much better off without that #$%$clown.
s<r731>                        they would suck him off to get him back. Name one team who wouldn't want him?
s<r733>                        That's probably Chicago coach
s<r740>                        yer a f'ing moron Aaron. Luck every year for 15 years. Such ignorance. Facepalm*
n<c742>                    where u at cHEAT fans where u at cHEAT fans where u at cHEAT fans yall probably hiding loser fools so proud to be a spurs man is and still proud of us tonight was as great night for us spurs fans everwyere! the good guys always winsners
s<c749>                    i cant remember seeing a team get beaten so badly 3 games in a row in a final.  often you see one game but whipped, but usually there is a bounce back.  not this time.
s<c763>                    A loss for LeMoron and the Heat is a win for all cities and NBA fans.. Makes it even sweeter that they got SMACKED... If anyone reads this and happens to know that blonde #$%$ that stuck her middle finger in Joakim Noahs face a couple years ago.. Please tell her that I couldn't be more happy that her team was embarrased and please tell her that she can return to her street corner
s<r769>                        Don't worry soon when he Shaq's out on ya'll you will make fun of him too.
n<c770>                    Thank you SPURS!! I could personally thank you all for winning and taking this overrated attention away from LeBron. 
n<r776>                        He shouldn't have given up with 5 min left
n<r777>                        Team ball, is why the heat lost the series. They didn't play it.
